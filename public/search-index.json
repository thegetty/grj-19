This ambiguity is due to the dispersion of book leaves and the lack of reliable colophons in early copies. The J. Paul Getty Museum preserves a few leaves of a Qurʼan that is one of the significant examples of Early Abbasid style. This Qurʼan was discovered in Kairouan, Tunisia, so historians have attributed its origin to that place. Yet, evidence proves it was produced in Central Iran. This evidence includes the eastern-system diacritic and the Abjad script used in the sign for the numeral ten *āyah*s; moreover, its script resembles the monumental script of some of the signed New style Qurʼans copied in Isfahan and Rayy. Because the Getty Qurʼan is copied in D.I script (the subgroup described by codicologist and paleographer François Déroche), the D.I script can be attributed to Central Iran.","content":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Islamic calligraphy thrived in two main realms in the first centuries of its flourishing. Officially, it was mostly employed by those charged with copying the Qurʼan and architectural inscriptions while adhering to prescribed rules and principles of calligraphy and attending to its aesthetic aspect through rigorous, direct strokes of the pen (<em>qalam</em>). Unofficially, it was generally employed in bureaucratic and everyday affairs, in which scribes used cursive and mostly unprincipled strokes of the pen. In the first realm, as early writers such as Ibn al-Nadim and today’s researchers show, Hijazi (Makkī/Madanī) scripts shaped the first stage of writing the Qurʼan.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Some scholars say that the classification of the scripts used in the Qurʼans of the first Islamic centuries (the seventh to ninth centuries CE) originated in copies that were preserved in Royal Danish Library by Orientalist and theologian Jacob Georg Christian Adler (1756–1834). Adler, according to firsthand sources, first used the title “Kufic” to refer to the script of the five copies in the library’s collection. Years later, on the basis of information gained from the introduction to <em>Al-Fihrist</em> by Ibn al-Nadīm, Italian historian Michele Amari (1806–1889) proposed the Makkī/Madanī scripts as the first to be used in copying the Qurʼan,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> although later his definitive view was challenged by Qur’anic paleographer Estelle Whelan and art historian Sheila Blair.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> Using Adler’s methodology for her 1939 publication, scholar of early Arabic scripts Nabia Abbott tried to resolve the discrepancies between texts and the surviving manuscripts by proposing a classification of scripts into the double categories of Makkī-Madanī and Basrī-Kufic under the title of Hijazi scripts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> Nevertheless, the problem of the diversity of styles and their nonuniformity with names of calligraphic scripts and terms from the texts remained unresolved.</p>\n<p>On the basis of classification propounded by Muslim historians such as Nāji Zayn al-dīn in 1972 and Habiballah Faẓā`ilī in 1973,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> another classification was proposed by British scholar Martin Lings in 1976 . In Lings’s classification, Kufic is reckoned to be the evolved form of the early scripts and, from the tenth century on, divided into two significant styles: Eastern Kufic, nearly encompassing Iran, and Western Kufic, encompassing Andalusia and North and West Africa.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> Despite this classification’s vast geographic and historic scope, which provided for a more rigorous recognition of scripts, it did not prevail.</p>\n<p>Challenging the term <em>Kufic,</em> codicologist and paleographer François Déroche proposed a more precise classification of straight scripts used in the Qurʼans in the first Islamic centuries. Because of the indeterminacy of the place and time of the early Kufic script’s genesis, he regarded Kufic as inappropriate for this style of writing and proposed replacing it with the title “Early Abbasid.” Moreover, he called the Qurʼanic scripts of the tenth to thirteenth centuries—identical to Eastern or Persian Kufic—New Abbasid. After rigorous study of the letters’ forms—reported first in 1983 in his book <em>Les manuscrits du coran: Aux origines de la calligraphie coranique</em> (The manuscripts of the Qur’an: Origins of Qura’nic calligraphy) and then in 1992 in <em>The Abbasid Tradition</em>—Déroche classified the scripts of the Qurʼan in the seventh to tenth centuries sequentially as Hijazi scripts (comprising four groups), Early Abbasid (comprising six groups), and New style (comprising two groups).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> This way, he could organize the miscellany of the styles of the Qurʼanic scripts in each of the three periods.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>Group D is the most numerous and diverse group of Early Abbasid script. It comprises five distinct styles, with one (D.v) being further divided into three subtypes. Déroche selected the basic letterforms for the purpose of comparison. Although the letters alif, <em>mim,</em> <em>nun,</em> and <em>ha</em> are rendered in different ways, their developmental sequence cannot be placed in chronological order. Generally, all types of Group D exhibit a thick script, with vertical upstrokes that are always perpendicular to the baseline.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>As Déroche declares in an elaboration of his method of classification and analyses of Abbasid style, our lack of knowledge about the copying of the Qurʼan in the eastern part of the Muslim world is rooted in the fact that the surviving leaves with Early Abbasid script have mostly been found in the western part. Due to the unavailability of reliable sources and copies, Déroche regards the styles of Qurʼan scripts in the east as quite indefinite.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> Considering the evidence available to him at the time, such a claim seems understandable to some extent, as all the Kufic Qurʼan fragments in the collections of his investigation lack information on the place of production. Because copies and manuscripts, such as the Amajur Qurʼan,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> were relocated or endowed to certain places, we have no solid reason to attribute their origins to their places of discovery. He regards any attempts to pinpoint origins as futile. This, along with the issue of determining the historical order of the script styles, are the two problematics in studies of the Qurʼan manuscripts of the first Islamic centuries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> Yet, there is evidence in some Qurʼan manuscripts that can guide us to determine the geographic scope of certain scripts.</p>\n<p>A few surviving leaves of a Qurʼan attributed to the ninth century offer us the possibility to surmise its script style’s geographic scope. The leaves of this manuscript are dispersed in different museums and collections; the highest number are preserved at the J. Paul Getty Museum. Before dispersion, the manuscript was discovered in Kairouan, Tunisia. Two leaves are kept in the National Library of Tunisia (Rutbi 198); therefore, it has been attributed to Kairouan by historians including Martin Lings<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> and to North Africa by catalogers of the Getty Museum.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup> Yet, resemblance of its script to the style of the copies produced in Iran suggests that the place of production of this Qurʼan manuscript was Central Iran. This study investigates the characteristics of the Getty manuscript’s leaves and relates evidence for its place of production.</p>\n<h2>The Fragmentary Kufic Qurʼan at the Getty Museum</h2>\n<p>Ten leaves of a Qurʼan manuscript produced in the horizontal format and written in outlined gold script on parchment are preserved in the Getty Museum (MS Ludwig X 1).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> Other leaves are listed in other collections and at auctions. In what follows, the characteristics of the Getty leaves and the other leaves’ places of preservation are expounded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Fragmentary Qur’an from the J.

This copy is likely to have been originally produced in thirty volumes, as five-lined Qurʼan manuscripts were generally divided into thirty separate parts, called <em>juzʾ</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> If this is true, it might be surmised that each volume must have been eighty to ninety pages, considering the approximate number of words on each folio.</p>\n<p>The ten leaves of the Getty Qurʼan constitute five bifolios. There are five lines on each leaf. Leaves one and two include <em>āyah</em>s (verses) of <em>āl ʿImrān</em> (3:122–26). Other leaves (folios 3–10) include <em>āyah</em>s of <em>al-anʿām</em> (6:106–22); apparently, two leaves of this part of the manuscript have been lost, as these leaves do not include <em>āyah</em>s (folios 3–10) 112–16. Leaf three, attached to leaf ten, includes <em>āyah</em>s of <em>ālʿImrān</em> (3:129–31). A rectangular illuminated panel is on the back of leaf 10v (<a href=\"#fig-1-1\">fig. 1</a>).

Such text has been assumed to be a feature of Iranian Qurʼans,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup> the most well-known of which is the Ibn al-Bawwab Qurʼan of 1001 now in the collection of the Chester Beatty Library in Dublin (Is. 1431).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup> Yet, the most ancient manuscript on paper is three volumes of a fourteen-part Qurʼan written in the vertical format in New style in 327 AH/939 CE, which, according to the autograph of its scribe, was copied in Isfahan (<a href=\"#fig-1-2\">fig. 2</a>).

Its scribe, Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Yāsīn, copied it in 383 AH/993 CE in Isfahan (TIEM, nos. 453–56). According to its precise calligraphy and conspicuous golden decorations, it was probably produced under the patronage of the courtiers of the Buyyid dynasty (945–1055 CE).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup> The numbers of its chapters, words, and letters are written in circles inside a horizontal rectangular panel. Scholar of Islamic art Yasser Tabbaa lists and illustrates other manuscripts containing tables with verse counts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> In the Getty Qurʼan, the rectangular panel on the front of the leaf (recto) is divided into two squares, each containing a circle. The four sets of intersecting lines radiating into the center of the circle intersect and form a diamond in the center of the circle. The surface decoration of the panel is totally overlaid with gold. The chain-like pattern of its margins and the ornamental dots of the background are all outlined in brown. This structure can also be seen in certain Qurʼan manuscripts copied in Abbasid style, an example of which is a fragment including <em>al-ḍuḥā</em> (Qur’an 93) to the end of the Qurʼan, written in Early Abbasid style, kept in the Chester Beatty Library.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup> The Chester Beatty manuscript includes two such illuminated leaves at its beginning and at its end. On each of these leaves, as was described for Getty folio 10 above, is a rectangular panel made up of two square frames divided by four triangles (<em>lachak</em>). On the other leaves of the Getty fragments, as previously described, the text is written in five lines in gold. Each word or letter is outlined in brown ink to make it distinct from the background.</p>\n<p>The <em>harakāt</em>, or diacritics marking short vowels, are shown by small circular dots in red ink: for <em>fatḥa</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ـَ</span>), a circular dot is inserted above the letter; for <em>kasra</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ـِ</span>), a dot underneath; for <em>ḍamma</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ـُ</span>), a dot in the left side. Nunnation (<em>tanwin</em>) is shown with two dots, one over the other. These features correspond to the elements of style attributed to Arab grammarian Abul Aswad al-Duʾali (d. 69 AH/688 CE), a poet and the founder of Arabic syntax. He invented, as Egyptian encyclopedist al-Qalqashandī informs us in 821 AH / 1418 CE, three main <em>harakāt</em> plus <em>tanwin</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup> The vocalization in this copy is mainly used in the last letter of almost all words, for it is normally the last letter that defines a word’s function in the sentence. If no vowel pointing is applied, misunderstanding and change in meaning would be inevitable. This practice of using vocalization exclusively for the last letter is attributed to al-Duʾali.</p>\n<p>Nunnation (<em>tanvīn</em>) in this Qurʼan is shown by two red dots. <em>Shadda</em> (a diacritic for doubling a consonant) is shown by a light-blue dot. There are no signs for <em>maddah</em> (long vowel) or the <em>hamza</em> (glottal stop). Because the light blue is the same one used in the illumination, the diacritics seem to have been inserted at the time when the manuscript was being copied. But the dots in dark blue otherwise surrounding the letters were inserted at a later time to complete diacritics or to demonstrate other modes of recitation (<em>qirāʾāt</em>) (<a href=\"#fig-1-3\">fig. 3</a>).</p>\n <figure id=\"fig-1-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-1-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/sahragard-03.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-1-3\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 3. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Folio 4r from the fragmentary Getty Qurʼan containing [<em>āyah</em>s?] 6:106–7; diacritics and vowel marks are shown by colored dots and medallions signify verse division.</strong> Los Angeles, J.

Saʾīd al-Dānī, historian of Islamic art and architecture Alain Fouad George has deduced new features of the regional methods of applying diacritics Qurʼan texts. George summarizes his findings in a table.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> According to his table, the vocalization of early Qur’ans copied in Iraq and Mashriq (a term designating the Arab east) was accomplished through the use of red dots for <em>fatḥa</em>, <em>kasra</em>, and <em>ḍamma</em>, two red dots for <em>tanwīn,</em> a red dot for hamza, and one dot after and above the <em>alif</em> for <em>hamza</em> followed by <em>madd</em>. A comparison between this table and the diacritics in the Getty Qurʼan confirms that the manuscript’s place of production is [the historical region of Persian?] Iraq or the eastern part of the Muslim world.</p>\n<p>In the Getty Qurʼan, the marker used for the ends of individual verses is a rosette inscribed within a blue circle with colored dots seen in many of the Abbasid Qurʼans, which was assigned the code of 3.1.4 by Déroche (see <a href=\"#fig-1-3\">fig. 3</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup> On folio 2v, the sign for the numeral five <em>āyah</em>s is a medallion inserted between the words, inside which the word “Khamsa” (five) is written and encircled by painted pudgy petals. This ornament is drawn over the last word of the <em>āyah</em> and almost conforms to group 4.A.I in Déroche’s classification.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> The sign for the numeral ten <em>āyah</em>s on folio 6r and 8v greatly resembles the sign for the numeral five <em>āyah</em>s; it differs in that, inside the medallion, the <em>āyah</em>’s numeral is written in Abjad letters. Plus, in the margin in front of the same line, another round medallion is drawn containing the <em>āyah</em>’s number in golden letters (<a href=\"#fig-1-4\">fig. 4</a>). In the leaves of the Getty Qurʼan, the signs for the numeral ten <em>āyah</em>s are inserted in the margin in front of line three for <em>āyah</em> 3:130 (3v), line five for <em>āyah</em> 6:120 (8v; see <a href=\"#fig-1-4\">fig. 4</a>), and line one for <em>āyah</em> 6:110 (6r).</p>\n <figure id=\"fig-1-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-1-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/sahragard-04.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-1-4\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 4. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Folio 8v (detail) from the fragmentary Getty Qurʼan containing the sign for the numeral ten <em>āyah</em>s after <em>āyah</em> 6:120, with letters <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ق ک</span>, and in the medallion in the margin, <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">مائة و عشرون</span> (a hundred and ten).</strong> Los Angeles, J.

But the order of Abjad letters in the western part of the Muslim world is different from their order in the eastern part.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup> Therefore, one of the main criteria for attributing a Qurʼan manuscript to the eastern or western part of the Muslim world is to examine the Abjad letters used for counting the <em>āyah</em>s, as art historian Jonathan Bloom does in attributing the early Fatamid Kufic manuscript known as the Blue Qur’an to the west of the Islamic world.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup> The signs used for the numeral ten <em>āyah</em>s on the leaves of the Getty Qur’an, however, are assigned to <em>āyah</em>s 110, 120, and 130, as shown by <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ق، ی</span>, <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ق، ک</span> and <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ق، ل</span>. There is no difference between the numeric value of these letters in the eastern and western Abjad systems. One folio of the Qur’an under discussion in this article in the National Library of Tunisia (Rubti 198)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup> includes <em>al-hajj</em> (22:43–44, 22: 63–66), which has a sign for sixtieth <em>āyah</em> written with a <span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">س</span>, one of the variable numbers used in the more common, eastern system.</p>\n<p>Throughout, <em>Iʾjām</em> diacritics (the dots distinguishing the consonant pointing), are respectively shown by very thin oblique black lines. The signs to for pause while reading (<em>waqf</em>) are indicated by dots of light and dark blue over the letters. This method has been attributed to Arabic linguist Yahya b. Yuʾmar (d. 129 AH/756 CE) and Arab grammarian Nasr b. ʿĀṣim (d. 89 AH / 708 CE). Purportedly, the fifth Umayyad caliph ʿAbd al-malik Marwān (r. 65–86 AH/685–705 CE) and governor of Hejaz and Iraq Hajjāj b. Yūsuf-i Thaqafī (r. 73–95 AH/692–714 CE) ordered its creation and establishment to help distinguish between formally similar letters.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>The handwriting of the fragmentary Qurʼan manuscript is bulky. Letters such as <em>alif</em> and <em>lām</em> are grounded on the baseline with no deviance. Déroche classifies the one leaf of this manuscript kept at the Khalili Collections, London, under the subgroup D.I and provides a description of its script.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup> The characteristics greatly resemble those of the monumental script used for endowments, sura headings, and the beginning notes of certain Qurʼan manuscripts in New style. The similarities of style in these Qurʼan scripts are evidence of their production in the same geographic scope. The Qurʼan produced in Isfahan in 327 AH/939 CE (mentioned above; (see <a href=\"#fig-1-2\">fig. 2</a>) is an example. The text with which this copy begins is part of an endowment, and the verse count is written in Early Abbasid style. Although the quality of the script does not show clearly due to imprecise outlining of the words, the geometry of the letters can be mapped onto the Déroche scripts, and the following properties can be extracted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>returning stroke of the lower portion of the isolated <em>alif</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">الف</span>) is longer and tip-pointed;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>medial <em>jim</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ـجـ</span>) is located on the baseline and the letter preceding it is located higher than it;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>first <em>ʾayn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ع</span>) has a wide, generally circular opening;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>medial <em>ʾayn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ـعـ</span>) is an inverted triangle, and the last ʾayn (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ـع</span>) has a sickle-like kern;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>mīm</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">م</span>) has a short horizontal kern on the baseline;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>nun</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ن</span>), the bowl of <em>sīn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">س</span>), and <em>yā</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ی</span>) are relatively big wide circles; and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>single <em>hā</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ه</span>) is a semicircle relying on a vertical line.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These characteristics conform to the general attributes of Déroche’s group D. Still, a more accurate recognition of the style of the script is difficult because, besides the low quality, there is an in-between quality to the letters’ forms. Most letters conform to subgroup D.I, but the curve of letters <em>nūn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ن</span>), <em>sīn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">س</span>), and <em>yā</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ی</span>) are written in the manner of subgroup D.va, and <em>alif</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">الف</span>) in subgroup D.III.</p>\n<p>A stronger resemblance can be seen in other Qurʼan manuscripts in New style. An example is the beginning of the seventh volume in a ten-volume Qurʼan copied by al-ʿabbās b. Muhammad b. al-ʿabbās al-Maṣāḥifī (the copyist of Qur’an manuscripts) al-Qazvīnī, containing its scribe’s autograph on two pages in Early Abbasid script. Its script mostly conforms to group D.I; only the letter <em>hā</em> conforms to group D.III, and the curve of letters <em>nūn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ن</span>), <em>sīn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">س</span>), and <em>yā</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ی</span>) are written in the manner of subgroup D.va (<a href=\"#fig-1-5\">fig. 5</a>). The autograph reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\" class=\"add-right-margin\">بسم الله الرحمن الرحیم<br>\nکتب هذا الجز<br>\nو اذهبه العباس<br>\nبن محمد القزوینی</p>\n<p>In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful<br>\ncopied this <em>juzʾ</em><br>\nand illuminated it al-Abbas<br>\nb.

Although the manuscript’s place of production is not noted, scholars know that, on the basis of another colophon related to a Qurʼan copied by this scribe, he is associated with the Buyyid dynasty’s court. He copied and illuminated the abovementioned Qurʼan manuscript between 387 and 391 AH/997 and 1000 CE for “Umm al-Umarā’s treasury” in Rayy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup></p>\n<p>Um al-Umarā or Um al-Mulūk (mother of kings) was the title of Sayyidah Malik Khātūn or Shīrīn Dukht-i Ispahbud Rustam-i Ṭabarī (d. 1028), the first Shiite woman ruler in the history of Iran. Belonging to the Bāvandiān family of Tabaristān, she married Fakhr al-Dawla Daylamī. Upon her husband’s death in 387 AH/997 CE, she officially became the ruler of the mountainous region (Jibāl) of the Buyyid realm of dominion. Her two sons—Shams al-Dawla Daylamī, governor of Hamedan (r. 387–412 AH/997–1021 CE), and Majd al-Dawla Daylamī, governor of Rayy (387–420 AH/997–1029 CE)—were mere children when they became governors. The forenamed scribe worked for the library of the Buyyid’s court; the script used in copying the manuscript is in New style and resembles the style of the aforementioned Qurʼan manuscript produced in Isfahan in 939.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">35</a></sup></p>\n<p>These characteristics are also seen in the monumental script of another copy of the Qur’an. On the basis of its resemblance to prior manuscripts, it was most probably copied in the tenth century in Central Iran (Library of Astan Quds Razavi, no. 5015), although it is missing the date of completion and the scribe’s autograph. It is the fourth volume of a ten-volume Qurʼan in which the sura headings and the insertions on the pages’ margins are written in Early Abbasid style. Its writing and the outlining of the golden Early Abbasid are more exacting compared to other examples. In the sura heading of <em>al-anʾām</em>, the forms of letters with the vertical tooth of medial <em>ʾayn</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">ـعـ</span>), the broad shape of <em>mīm</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">م</span>), the head of <em>wāw</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">و</span>) on the baseline, and the short arms of <em>lā</em> (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"rtl\">لا</span>) conform to subgroups D.I and D.va (<a href=\"#fig-1-6%5D\">fig. 6</a>).

In circles inside the panels on its beginning pages, the numbers of its suras, words, and letters are written in Early Abbasid style.

The Getty Qurʼan’s script entirely conforms to the style of the monumental script of the Qurʼan manuscripts from Central Iran. Therefore, not only does it seem possible to attribute the production of the Getty Qurʼan to Central Iran but it is also possible to propose a strong hypothesis attributing mix of D.I and D.va script to Central Iran.</p>\n <figure id=\"table-1-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--table is-table-scale-6\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#table-1-1\" title=\"Letters in the Getty Qurʼan; in the monumental script of the Qurʼan manuscripts copied in New style; and in François Déroche’s D.I and D.va classification.\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <table id=\"sahragard-table-01\"> <thead> <tr> <th>&nbsp;</th> <th><em>alif</em></th> <th colspan=\"2\"><em>jīm / ḥā / khā</em></th> <th><em>ṭā / ẓā</em></th> <th colspan=\"2\"><em>ayn / ghayn</em></th> <th><em>qāf</em></th> <th colspan=\"2\"><em>mīm</em></th> <th colspan=\"2\"><em>nūn</em></th> <th><em>hā</em></th> <th><em>lā</em></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Getty fragmentary Kufic Qurʼan</td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image001.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image002.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image003.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image004.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image005.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image006.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image007.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image008.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image009.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image010.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image011.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image012.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Isfahan Qurʼan</td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image013.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image014.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image015.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image016.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image017.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image018.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image019.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image020.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> <td><img src=\"/_assets/tables/sahragard-table-01-images/image021.jpg\" alt=\"\"></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Abbās b.

Yet, close examination of the Qurʼan manuscripts written in New style helps us acquire knowledge of regional styles of Qurʼanic calligraphy, at least in the eastern part of the Muslim world. Certain Qurʼan manuscripts contain inscriptions and insertions written in Early Abbasid style; due to their greater quantity and the intactness of their scribes’ autographs, they provide more accurate information regarding their place of production. Thus we have seen ample evidence that both the fragmentary Getty Qurʼan and the mix of D.I and D.va style can be traced to Central Iran. In short, the evidence is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The insertion of a verse count at the beginning of the Getty Qur’an, containing the number of chapters (suras), words, and letters, which is also included in New style Qurʼans produced in Central Iran, such as the Qurʼan copied in 327 AH/939 CE and the one scribed by Ahmad b. Muhammad b. Yāsīn in 383 AH/993 CE, both produced in Isfahan.</li>\n<li>The resemblance of the Abjad system for counting the <em>āyah</em>s in the Getty Qur’an to the Abjad system common in the eastern part of the Muslim world.</li>\n<li>The considerable resemblance of the Getty Qurʼan’s script to the monumental script of the Qurʼan manuscripts produced in Central Iran.</li>\n<li>The resemblance of the diacritics used in the Getty Qurʼan to the tradition of the eastern part of the Muslim world, as found in <em>Al-Muḥkam fi Naqt al-Maṣāḥif</em> by Abu ʾAmr Uthmān b. Saʾīd al-Dānī.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"grj-contributor-bio\"><strong>Mahdi Sahragard</strong> is an assistant professor in the Department of Architecture at Islamic Azad University, Mashhad Branch, Mashhad, Iran.</p>\n<h2 class=\"notes-heading\">Notes</h2>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ibn al-Nadim, <em>Al-Fihrist</em> [377 AH/987 CE], ed.

The initial depicts a barefoot, bearded, and haloed male figure holding a scroll—typical iconography for an Old Testament prophet. The outlines are drawn in dark-brown ink, and the figure’s draperies, neck, and feet are modeled in two tones of blue and an orange-red, allowing the bare parchment to act as highlights; the visible hand, face, and hair are modeled in shades of brown, also with bare parchment for highlight areas. The prophet stands against a deep-red background within a green initial <em>U</em> (the letter is interchangeable with <em>V</em> in medieval Latin) with simple foliate motifs, which opens the Old Testament book of Micah: “Verbum domini quo factum est ad Micheam Morastiten” (The word of the Lord that came to Micah the Morasthite). The lower left and right corners of the green letter and its red background show that, as usual, the artist had to fit his design into spaces left in the text by the scribe. Above the initial are the closing words of the book of Jonah, “Explicit Ionas propheta” ([Here] ends Jonah the prophet), and a line of stylized majuscules against a green background, “Incipit Mich[eas]. P[ro]pheta” ([Here] begins Micah the prophet), above which the same words are written in more easily legible twelfth-century script in red ink. The scribe who added this line in red also altered the spelling of the word “Micheam” a few lines down, because the original scribe had omitted the <em>e</em>. The writing is guided by horizontal rulings in gray plummet (often called lead point, the medieval equivalent of pencil). The second-from-bottom line of writing is placed between two such horizontal lines rules that extend all the way to the left edge of the cutting. Where they meet the extreme left edge, a small oblique stroke is visible, resembling the hyphens in the right-hand margin that mark word breaks at the ends of some lines of script: this suggests that the cutting was originally the right-hand side of a two-column page. In the upper-left margin of the cutting, in line with the prophet’s head, is a large red <em>S</em> flanked by dots, while the lower-right corner has an ink stamp in the form of a circle enclosing a letter <em>M</em>, or an upside-down <em>W</em>; the significance of these will be explained below. The cutting is stuck down onto a piece of card, so the reverse is not clearly legible, but a few lines of text are partially visible through the translucent parchment.</p>\n<h2>The Corpus of Known Cuttings</h2>\n<p>In 1931 art historian Paul Wescher published the first catalog of the Berlin Kupferstichkabinett collection of illuminated manuscripts, which includes twelve cuttings from a Bible “from the South East of France, dating to the first half of the twelfth century.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> It was more than half a century later that the cutting now held by the Getty Museum appeared for sale in London, but only three years after this sale another appeared at auction in Cologne; the latter is now in a private collection.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> Thus, at the end of the twentieth century, the total number of known cuttings stood at fourteen. Then, in June 2004, art historian Robert Schindler, as part of a project to search the storerooms of the Kupferstichkabinett for uncataloged material, found thirty-eight more unlisted cuttings, more than tripling the known corpus, but he did not have the opportunity to analyze them further.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Nearly twenty years later, these cuttings still remain practically unknown and largely unpublished, except for four that were reproduced in print in 2010 by art historian Beate Braun-Niehr, who attributed them to the Meuse region of Belgium and dated them to the second quarter of the twelfth century.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> Since then, the Berlin and Getty cuttings have been discussed briefly in our research.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> The goal of the present article is to reconsider in much greater detail the entire group—including the private-collection cutting—which we will refer to collectively as the Getty-Berlin cuttings. Specifically, our aims include making the unpublished cuttings better known; shedding light on their date and origin through a stylistic analysis; examining their modern provenance; and proposing a partial reconstruction of both the original mise-en-page of individual full leaves and of their original sequence in the multivolume Bible from which they come. An appendix lays out this reconstruction, detailing their textual contents, decorations, and more.</p>\n<h2>Reconstruction of the Original Layout and Dimensions</h2>\n<p>The original layout and page dimensions can be extrapolated with some confidence. Many cuttings show that the text was laid out in two columns (as was, and still is, conventional for Bibles), while measurements from individual cuttings reveal that the column width is about 10.5 centimeters, the space between the columns about 0.28 centimeters, and the space between each horizontal line about 0.9–1 centimeters.</p>\n<p>A first clue to the overall layout comes from the horizontal rulings on each cutting.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> Throughout the medieval period it was very common for the one or two top and bottom horizontal lines to be ruled across the full width of the page, while most of the remaining lines extended to the width of the text column. In large twelfth- and thirteenth-century manuscripts, the middle horizontals were often ruled all the way across the page as well; or instead, sometimes it was three or four ruled lines that were so extended. Among the current group, the prologue cuttings of Acts, I Chronicles, and the Minor Prophets show that the top three horizontal lines were ruled across the page; the prologue cuttings of Malachi, Zephaniah, and Chronicles show that the bottom three lines were ruled across the page; and the initials of Hosea, Obadiah, Malachi, Habakkuk, Ezekiel, Esther, Zacharias, Isaiah, II Chronicles, Romans, Daniel, and Micah all show that the middle three lines were ruled across the page.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> The cutting with the prologue to the Pauline Epistles has twenty-seven lines in total: sixteen are above the three at the midpoint of the page (and eight are below them); so there must be at least sixteen lines between the top and midpoint rulings; each column must have had at least thirty-five (16 + 3 + 16) lines of text.</p>\n<p>We can be more specific. The large Esther cutting preserves the last four lines of the book of Tobit and the first thirteen of the book of Esther itself, decorated with a fine historiated initial <em>I</em> (<a href=\"#fig-2-2\">fig. 2</a>). Because the incipit to the prologue occurs at the bottom of the left column, the prologue itself must have begun at the top of the right column. Given the incipit of the main text begins fourteen lines from the bottom of the right column, we can deduce that the missing prologue must have occupied all but fifteen lines of a full column. The surviving text of Esther (after the incipit in large red and blue display majuscules, which occupy twice the height of a line of regular script) fills thirteen lines and is seventy-two words long—that is, between five and six words per line. The missing prologue text (according to a printed version) is about 143 words long.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> Thus, the missing text would have occupied almost exactly twice the space occupied by the surviving text: if 72 words occupy 13 lines, then 143 words should occupy 26 lines. The prologue’s explicit may have occupied one additional line, judging by some of the other cuttings. These numbers suggest a column height of about 40 lines (prologue text [26 lines] + Esther incipit [1] + Esther text [13]), or 41 lines, if the explicit was written on a separate line.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2-2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/alai-kidd-02.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2-2\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 2. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Historiated initial <em>I</em> (<em>In diebus</em>) with Esther, ca. 1160s.</strong> Berlin, Kupferstichkabinett, Min. 1904.

We have calculated that there were probably about forty lines per column, and measurement shows that ten lines occupy about 9.5 centimeters, so forty lines would have been about 38 centimeters high. Adding an estimate for the upper and lower margins to this calculation, we may provisionally suggest an overall leaf height between 45 and 60 centimeters.</p>\n<p>These extrapolated dimensions, although imprecise, are consistent with the grand scale of French Romanesque illuminated Bibles. Often referred to as lectern Bibles, these volumes would have been too heavy to move around with ease and were therefore typically kept on a lectern in a monastery’s choir for the prescribed biblical readings of the Divine Office or in the refectory to be read aloud during meals.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> If we take as a sample the French Bibles cataloged by Walter Cahn in 1982, we find that the leaves of most of them (with a few outliers) range from 45.5 to 55.5 centimeters in height and from 33 to 38 centimeters in width.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup> We should not make too much of these broad comparisons of dimensions, however, as most medieval manuscripts have been trimmed at least once during rebinding. The main point is that the dimensions proposed here for the Bible from which the Getty-Berlin cuttings derive are consistent with what we would expect.</p>\n<h2>Decoration</h2>\n<p>Looking at the whole group of initials, each from twelve to twenty lines high, the most impressive are the eleven depicting standing or seated figures. They can be identified, thanks to their adjacent texts, as the Old Testament prophets Isaiah, Daniel, Hosea, Amos, Obadiah, Micah, and Zacharias; the heroines Ruth and Esther; King Solomon enthroned; and—the sole New Testament figure—Saint Paul writing.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> The protagonists are set against a red, blue, green, or yellow background, occasionally ornamented by white dots in geometric patterns. The same solid color backgrounds are used for nonfigurative initials, such as the initial <em>O</em> of “Onus,” for Nahum (<a href=\"#fig-2-3\">fig. 3</a>). The contrast between the colors of the frame, ground, and body of the initials creates a vivid mosaic. In addition to the eleven historiated initials, there are forty-one large decorated letters with intricate spirals of heart-shaped acanthus leaves, brightly colored with red, blue, green, and yellow ink, the inner parts often filled by small dots and striations. In one case, the initial <em>I</em> for “In principio” at the beginning of Genesis contains burnished gold (<a href=\"#fig-2-4\">fig. 4</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> The bodies of the initials are sometimes divided into geometric sections with a double contour line and decorated with vegetal elements symmetrically arranged; in one case, one side of the initial letter is formed of a dragon with long neck and tail (Min. 4679).

In 1084, Saint Bruno, the founder of the order, established the Grande Chartreuse in southeastern France between Grenoble and Chambéry, and the life of the monks came to be regulated by the Consuetudines (Customs) composed by the fifth prior, Guigo, between 1121 and 1128.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> As reported by Guibert, abbot of Nogent-sous-Coucy, who visited the Grande Chartreuse between 1115 and 1117, the community lived in poverty, and the church had no embellishment other than a silver goblet and the library. The monks had already gathered a conspicuous number of decorated manuscripts, and the library was continuously enriched thanks to the activity of copyists, mainly the monks themselves.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> During the twelfth century, thirty-six Carthusian sister houses were founded in Europe, among which was the Chartreuse (charterhouse) of Liget, in the French diocese of Tours: it was founded by King Henry II of England, perhaps in atonement for the murder of Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1170.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>A first comparison with our fragments can be seen with the so-called Liget Bible in five volumes, dating from the last third of the twelfth century. Written by four scribes, it was painted by two illuminators, one responsible for the first three volumes and part of the fifth (up until fol. 129v), and the second for the rest.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> If we look at the pages completed by the first illuminator, we can easily recognize how the decorative patterns of the incipit letters, made of symmetrical, heart-shaped vegetal spirals and colorful tendrils set on red, green, blue, or yellow backgrounds, are the same as the Berlin cuttings—for example, the initial <em>O</em> for “Osculetur” (<a href=\"#fig-2-5\">fig. 5</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup> Moreover, the initial <em>L</em> for “Liber” at the beginning of the Gospel of Matthew,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup> with a blue ground ornamented with white dots, is identical to the <em>I</em> at the beginning of Genesis in Berlin (see <a href=\"#fig-2-4\">fig. 4</a>). In addition, the figures that inhabit the initials of the Liget Bible, especially in the third volume (Ms. Latin 11508), show more than a passing resemblance to those of the Getty-Berlin group: the robust, cylindrical forms of the bodies, showing the limbs; the shapes underlined by garments falling down in the so-called damp fold;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> the mantles ending in a zigzag pattern; the essential facial features; the solemn gestures inherited from classical antiquity through Byzantine art, typical of the Romanesque products from the late eleventh century onward. Eloquent comparisons can also be established between Isaiah in the Kupferstichkabinett example (<a href=\"#fig-2-6\">fig. 6</a>) and the <em>V</em> for “Vir” representing Job in the Liget Bible (<a href=\"#fig-2-7\">fig. 7</a>); and between Zacharias in the Kupferstichkabinett cutting (Min. 1905) and the <em>O</em> for “Omnis” with Christ and a Personification of Wisdom from the Liget Bible (<a href=\"#fig-2-8\">fig. 8</a>). We recognize the same physiognomies, with curved eyebrows and irregular profiles; Christ and Daniel have long heart-shaped noses, and big noses in the case of the men and Isaiah. As other scholars have pointed out, the Liget Bible is very closely connected to manuscripts from the Grande Chartreuse, especially the Bible of Notre-Dame de Casalibus, which was made by 1132 and has almost the same textual prologues.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup> The Great Bible of the Grande Chartreuse has been dated circa 1170–1174 by Mielle de Becdelièvre on the basis of it being written partly by the same scribe as a homiliary of the Grande Chartreuse, which itself can be dated on the basis of whether saints are present (some of whom were added to the Carthusian calendar circa 1170) or absent (notably Thomas Becket, who was added to the Carthusian calendar circa 1174).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> It was written by two main scribes and illuminated by fine artists led by the so-called Genesis Master, who is none other than the artist responsible for the parts of the Liget Bible written by its second scribe.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/alai-kidd-05.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2-5\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 5. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Decorated initial <em>O</em> (<em>Osculetur</em>), last third of the twelfth century.</strong> From the Liget Bible, Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale de France, Ms. Latin 11508, fol. 35r.

In fact, scholars have long recognized that this way of drawing sprouts, with the veins of the leaves clearly visible, derives from Cistercian manuscripts made for Cîteaux and Clairvaux in the first half of the twelfth century. If we look at the <em>De civitate dei</em> (City of God) of the third quarter of the twelfth century (<a href=\"#fig-2-10\">figs. 10</a>, <a href=\"#fig-2-11\">11</a>),<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup> for example, the similarity of the scrolling vegetal tendrils filled with pen striations symmetrically arranged in a figure-eight shape, with most of the letters set on a monochrome field, is quite evident. The same goes for the <em>Lectionarium officii Cisterciense</em> (Lectionary of the Cistercian office) and the <em>Opus imperfectum in Matthaeum</em> (Incomplete work on Matthew’s Gospel), both now in Troyes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup> Another comparison is possible with the famous Bible of Stephen Harding, dated 1109 in the second of four volumes (which was originally the end of the first of two volumes), and perhaps finished a year or two later (<a href=\"#fig-2-12\">fig. 12</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup> Besides the use of pen drawing, the shape of the acanthus leaves and the colors filling the interstices are also basically the same as those seen in the Carthusian manuscripts; when analyzing the books originally from Cîteaux (such as Mss. 32, 131, 159, 180, 641, now at the Bibliothèque Municipale in Dijon<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup>), it is immediately clear that their decorative patterns heavily influenced the illuminators active for the Grande Chartreuse.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-10\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2-10\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/alai-kidd-10.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2-10\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 10. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Decorated initial <em>G</em> (<em>Gloriosissimam</em>), third quarter of the twelfth century.</strong> From <em>De civitate dei,</em> Dijon, Bibliothèque Municipale, Ms. 159, fol. 2v.

Containing two Carthusian texts (the <em>Consuetudines Cartusiae</em> and the first part of the <em>Supplementa ad Consuetudines Cartusiae</em>), it was produced at the Grande Chartreuse but was owned by the abbey of Cîteaux during the twelfth century, perhaps as a gift from Abbot Antelme to Abbot Goswin, who headed the Cistercian abbey of Bonnevaux from 1141 to 1151 and then Cîteaux from 1151 to 1155.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fnref37\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">37</a></sup></p>\n<p>Even though we no longer have the whole Bible, it is clear that the Getty-Berlin cuttings represent some of its most important incipits. Despite the facts that there are no full-page miniatures (as found in a few of the most lavishly decorated Bibles), and that ocher and yellow usually have to stand in for gold, the biblical books and their prologues are introduced by elegant vegetal knots, and many have figures magnificently staged within the initials, as in the Liget Bible or Great Bible. These Bibles exceed the cuttings in quality and complexity of representation: in the Great Bible, the beginning of Genesis is ornamented by a full-page historiated initial <em>I</em> (“In principio”) under an arch, depicting the Creation, other Old Testament scenes, and the Incarnation;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fnref38\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">38</a></sup> and in the Liget Bible, the Creation story is depicted within a giant historiated initial of five medallions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fnref39\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">39</a></sup> The cutting in Berlin, however, merely offers scrolling acanthus leaves forming four circular loops one above the other, somewhat analogous to the round medallions in which Creation scenes are often arranged in Genesis initials.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fnref40\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">40</a></sup> In both the Liget and Great Bibles, there are many initials depicting groups of figures or events—such as the representations of Solomon enthroned<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fnref41\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">41</a></sup> and of Job suffering (see <a href=\"#fig-2-7\">fig. 7</a>)—while in the cuttings, we have only single figures.</p>\n<p>Scholars have studied the evolution of book decoration within the Grande Chartreuse library, recognizing a few exceptional cases in which the texts are accompanied by a rich ornamental program, including the Bible of Notre-Dame de Casalibus, completed before 1132, and the Great Bible of circa 1170. Especially in this latter case, copiously illustrated, the function of the decoration could be either a tool for the meditation of the reader or a literal representation of the contents.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fnref42\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">42</a></sup> As for the cuttings, the figured initials are portraits of prophets, Saint Paul, Solomon, Ruth, and Esther, while the decorated initials have a functional purpose—marking the incipits—as well as an ornamental one. The Bible from which the cuttings were taken can thus be put in a relative chronological sequence between the Bible of Notre-Dame de Casalibus and either the Great Bible or the Liget Bible, offering a good mix of decorated and figured initials, superseding the older pattern of the first Bible but not reaching the pictorial complexity of the second.</p>\n<p>However, only the style allows us to establish a link with the Grande Chartreuse or, more precisely, with a Carthusian monastery. There is neither an ownership inscription nor documentary evidence connecting the cuttings with any of the charterhouses; there are no inventories of the Liget monastery library; and those of the Grande Chartreuse library are too vague to allow us to positively identify our now-dismembered Bible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fnref43\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">43</a></sup> Two historical facts may be relevant here. First, when the monks of the Grande Chartreuse were expelled from the monastery in 1792 in the wake of the French Revolution, the manuscripts of its library were mainly transferred to the municipal library in Grenoble. Second, the famous manuscript thief Guglielmo Libri visited the library at Grenoble in October 1842, where he was left unsupervised, and library stamps cut from Grenoble volumes were discovered among his papers when he was brought to trial in 1850 for his thefts from many French libraries.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fnref44\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">44</a></sup> It is also possible that our Bible came from one of the other major Carthusian monasteries, such as the Chartreuse of Portes, Écouges, Currière, Pierre-Châtel, or Liget.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fnref45\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">45</a></sup> Moreover, the style itself is no guarantee that the original manuscript belonged to the Grande Chartreuse; in fact, the peculiar decoration of the Grande Chartreuse books became, by the end of the twelfth century, typical of many other workshops active for religious communities in the southeast of France.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fnref46\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">46</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Script</h2>\n<p>Analysis of the handwriting does not (in the current state of our knowledge) connect the cuttings to a precise Carthusian foundation; it simply confirms that the Bible was written around about the 1160s. The writing shows the typical characteristics of late Caroline minuscule script, in the transitional phase, sometimes called pre-Gothic or proto-Gothic, before the emergence of the fully Gothic <em>littera textualis.</em> Features of this period are the use, in combination, of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the round <em>s</em> at the end of words (see, for example, fig. 1, last line, “eius”; “dominus” abbreviated to “dns”; and “deus” abbreviated to “ds”) and the tall <em>s</em> used at the beginning of the words “samariam” and “super,” three and four lines from the bottom</li>\n<li>both uncial <em>d</em> (with the ascender slanting to the left) and <em>d</em> with an upright ascender (both forms are found on the bottom two lines of fig. 1: “audite, “attendite,” and “plenitudo”; cf. “dns” and “ds”)</li>\n<li>both “et” and the ampersand (<em>&amp;</em>) (the Genesis cutting, fig. 4, mostly uses “et,” but the ampersand also occurs once; see also the bottom two lines of the Getty cutting, fig. 1)</li>\n<li>a few ligatures persist, such as <em>st</em> (see, for example, “testem,” the very last word of the Getty cutting, fig. 1)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some differences in the writing among the cuttings suggest the participation of at least two scribes. If we compare, for example, the Esther cutting (see <a href=\"#fig-2-2\">fig. 2</a>) with the Getty cutting (see <a href=\"#fig-2-1\">fig. 1</a>), several differences are readily apparent. Overall, the former’s script is more laterally compressed, with letters and their individual strokes closer together; the common abbreviation mark to indicate a missing <em>m</em> or <em>n</em> is a horizontal stroke with serifs (very unlike the curved form found, for example, twice on the last line of the Getty cutting); the Tironian symbol for “et” (shaped somewhat like a <em>7</em>) appears (for example, twice in the first line of the left column) alongside the ampersand (for example in lines 4 and 9 of the right column); the <em>ct</em> ligature is still joined, not broken as in the Getty cutting (line 2 of the main text, “factum”); and other letterforms have small differences. Punctuation also provides corroborating evidence as to the date: we see an abundant use of the <em>punctus elevatus, punctus interrogativus,</em> and <em>punctus versus,</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fnref47\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">47</a></sup> but the <em>punctus flexus,</em> introduced by “early Cistercian scribes to assist readers in deciphering the sense of unfamiliar texts”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fnref48\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">48</a></sup> and later adopted by Carthusian scribes, is absent. As noticed by Dominique Mielle de Becdelièvre, the <em>punctus flexus</em> features in the Great Bible from the Grande Chartreuse but not in the older Notre-Dame de Casalibus one,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fnref49\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">49</a></sup> again suggesting that the Bible to which the cuttings belong was a product of about the 1160s.</p>\n<p>It is not possible to understand with certainty how the task of writing the manuscript was divided, in part because of an almost complete lack of evidence concerning the original quire structure. In her magisterial study of French Romanesque Carthusian manuscripts, Mielle de Becdelièvre notes that many books from the Grande Chartreuse were written by more than one scribe, and her comparative analysis of the texts demonstrates that there was no systematic division of the work, not even for the rubrics. She suggests that in some cases the differing styles of script might be attributed to a master and a student.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fnref50\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">50</a></sup> Concerning the production of manuscripts within the Carthusian Order, in general, we know that writing was recommended in the <em>Consuetudines</em> by Guigo:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fnref51\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">51</a></sup> the monks were supposed to copy books during the day in their own cells, as attested also by Peter the Venerable.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fnref52\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">52</a></sup> Given the strict rule of anonymity of the scribes, it is almost impossible to find names of the copyists who spent three or four daylight hours in winter and eight or nine hours in summer doing the <em>opus manum</em> (manual work), using the writing instruments listed by Guigo including quill pens and a penknife for cutting, pumice stones and chalk for preparing the surface of the parchment, and ink horns and a sharp knife or razor for erasing mistakes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fnref53\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">53</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Text</h2>\n<p>Before analyzing the text of the cuttings, it is necessary to know what to expect of a twelfth-century Bible in general terms. The Bible in use today is based, in many important ways, on an “edition” of the Bible commonly known as the Paris Bible, which was formulated in the early thirteenth century and disseminated across Europe from Paris by the middle of the same century. The Paris Bible has a specific selection of biblical books, in a fixed sequence, most of them preceded by specific prologues, and each book is divided into chapters at fixed points. The Paris Bible also set a new standard for the authority of the words of the text itself, earlier copies having become more and more corrupted by the compounding effect of successive scribal errors from one copy to the next. Important to our present purposes is that, prior to establishment of the Paris Bible, Bibles varied considerably; the selection of books, their prologues, their texts, their sequences, and their divisions into chapters were not standardized. In addition, earlier Bibles often included features that are not found in the Paris Bible, notably capitula lists—that is, brief summaries of the subject matter of the chapters, placed before individual books, similar to tables of contents. Modern Bibles often have a short summary at the beginning of each chapter, such as “Christ’s sermon upon the mount; the eight beatitudes,” but in capitula lists, such summaries are grouped together at the beginning of each biblical book.</p>\n<p>It follows from this that in order to reconstruct and understand the original form of the Bible from which the Getty-Berlin cuttings come, we must use all available clues to its textual contents, which may not follow a standard sequence. The appendix to this article attempts to present this reconstruction in detail, but it may be useful to provide an example here. The recto of one cutting (Min. 159) has a portion of text from near the end of the book of Ecclesiasticus (alias Sirach) and, on its verso, a prologue to the book of Job. Another cutting (Min. 138) has part of a different prologue to Job on its recto, and part of Job chapter 1 on its verso. The recto of a third cutting (Min. 140) has text from near the end of the book of Job, with a prologue to Tobit on its verso. From these three cuttings we can deduce that the parent volume had the following sequence of six texts: Ecclesiasticus, followed by a prologue to Job; another prologue to Job, followed by the book of Job itself; and a prologue to Tobit, which was doubtless followed by the book of Tobit itself. This is entirely unlike the order of texts found in the Paris Bible and modern editions, in which Job is adjacent neither to Ecclesiasticus nor Tobit but is instead between Esther and the Psalms. As we will see in due course, the sequence of these three biblical books as represented by the cuttings is highly significant.</p>\n<p>Some sequences of biblical books, as represented by the Getty-Berlin cuttings, are typical. For example, the first eight books of the Bible (known collectively as the Octateuch) run in the standard sequence: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, and Ruth.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fnref54\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">54</a></sup> Similarly, the Twelve Minor Prophets appear as a group in their usual sequence. Some cuttings provide no clues as to what preceded or followed them: examples are cuttings with portions of the books of Wisdom (Min. 168) and Acts (Min. 132). Large parts of the Bible, including most of the Pauline Epistles and all of the Gospels, are not represented at all in the known cuttings, suggesting the possibility that they were in one or more separate volumes that are entirely lost (large-scale twelfth-century Bibles were typically bound in two, three, or four volumes).</p>\n<p>Lectern Bibles written for use in Carthusian houses have the individual books arranged in an apparently eccentric sequence; the reason for this is that they were intended to correspond more closely to (but rarely the same as) the order of the liturgical Matins and refectory readings of the year, as stipulated in the Carthusian Statutes, as follows (here in simplified summary form):<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fnref55\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">55</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advent to Christmas Eve: Isaiah, Daniel (Statutes 2.2)</li>\n<li>Epiphany to Septuagesima: Pauline Epistles (Statutes 4.1)</li>\n<li>Septuagesima to Passion Sunday: Genesis to Judges (The Heptateuch) (Statutes 4.4)</li>\n<li>Passion Sunday to Maundy Thursday: Jeremiah (Statutes 4.13)</li>\n<li>Triduum (Last Supper to Easter evening): Lamentations</li>\n<li>Easter to Pentecost: Acts, Catholic Epistles, Revelation (Statutes 4.32)</li>\n<li>Pentecost to August: I–II Samuel, I–II Kings, I–II Chronicles (Statutes 5.1)</li>\n<li>August to September: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus (Statutes 5.2)</li>\n<li>September to October: Job, Tobit, Judith, Esther (Statutes 5.3)</li>\n<li>October to November: I–II Maccabees (Statutes 5.4)</li>\n<li>November to Advent: Ezekiel, the Twelve Minor Prophets, Daniel (Statutes 2.2)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"remove-paragraph-indent\">The Great Bible, for example, has almost exactly this sequence:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fnref56\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">56</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vol. I: Ezekiel, Daniel, Minor Prophets, Isaiah, Pauline Epistles</li>\n<li>Vol. II: Heptateuch, Jeremiah, Lamentations</li>\n<li>Vol. III: Acts, Catholic Epistles, Revelation, I–II Samuel, I–II Kings, I–II Chronicles</li>\n<li>Vol. IV: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Job, Tobit, Judith, Esther, I–II Maccabees</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"remove-paragraph-indent\">The biggest differences between this order of books and the order in which we usually find them in Bibles from the thirteenth century onward are that</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jeremiah and Lamentations follow the Heptateuch, rather than following Isaiah;</li>\n<li>Acts, the Catholic Epistles, and Revelation, which usually occur at the end of the New Testament, occur instead between the Old Testament books of the prophet Jeremiah and the historical books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles;</li>\n<li>Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus precede, rather than follow, Job, Tobit, Judith, and Esther;</li>\n<li>I–II Maccabees follow Job, Tobit, Judith, and Esther, rather than occurring at the end of the Old Testament;</li>\n<li>Isaiah follows the Twelve Minor Prophets, rather than preceding the other Major and the Minor Prophets;</li>\n<li>the Pauline Epistles follow Isaiah (and Daniel); and</li>\n<li>the Gospels are absent.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"remove-paragraph-indent\">In the Getty-Berlin cuttings we find that, as above,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Job follows Ecclesiasticus;</li>\n<li>Job precedes, not follows, Tobit, Judith, and Esther;</li>\n<li>Daniel follows the Twelve Minor Prophets; and</li>\n<li>the Gospels are absent (or at least not represented by any known cutting).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Carthusian Lection Markings</h2>\n<p>Beyond stylistic analyses of script and decoration and the peculiar sequence of the biblical books, other features of the Getty-Berlin cuttings demonstrate conclusively that the parent Bible was used by Carthusians. In our description of the Getty cutting at the beginning of this article, we noted the presence of a red <em>S</em> in the left margin, next to the start of the text (<a href=\"#fig-2-1\">see fig. 1</a>). Similar marginal notations occur on other cuttings in Berlin, including majuscule letters <em>P</em> (Proverbs 1:29, Zechariah 1:1), <em>S</em> (Joel 2:18), and <em>T</em> (Haggai 1:1); Roman numerals <em>I</em> (Daniel 1:1, Joel 1:1), <em>II</em> (Isaiah 1:1, Nahum 1:1, Malachi 1:1), and <em>III</em> (Habakkuk 1:1); and minuscule letters <em>a</em> (II Samuel 1:1, Proverbs 1:29, Ezekiel prologue), <em>b</em> (II Samuel 1:5, II Samuel 2:18, Tobit 1:1, Ezekiel 1:1, Romans 1:1, Corinthians 1:1), <em>c</em> (Judith 1:5, II Samuel 2:22), <em>d</em> (Ecclesiasticus 50:15), <em>e</em> (Proverbs 30:15), <em>f</em> (Romans 16:17), <em>g</em> (I Samuel 1:28?), and <em>h</em> (Tobit 12:20). All these forms of annotation are characteristic of Carthusian Bibles. The letters <em>P, S,</em> and <em>T</em> stand for <em>primus, secundus,</em> and <em>tertius</em> (or <em>prima lectio, secunda lectio,</em> and <em>tertia lectio</em>) and indicate the start of the three biblical lections read on weekdays by Carthusians. Sometimes <em>I, II,</em> and <em>III</em> are used in their place. Also Carthusian is the presence in the margins of the first eight letters of the alphabet, <em>a</em> to <em>h,</em> to indicate the eight biblical lections to be read on Sundays and major feast days.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fnref57\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">57</a></sup> (This is not to be confused with the method, probably developed by the Paris Dominicans in the thirteenth century, of dividing parts of a work into subsections using the first seven letters of the alphabet, <em>a</em> to <em>g.</em>)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fnref58\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">58</a></sup> The three different types of markings in the Getty-Berlin cuttings may represent successive stages of annotation: the cutting with the decorated initial at the start of Proverbs, for example, has on its verso a Roman numeral <em>I</em> in brown ink, overwritten with a <em>P</em> in red, next to which is an <em>a,</em> also in red.</p>\n<h2>Modern Provenance</h2>\n<p>When or whence the Berlin cuttings entered the Kupferstichkabinett is not certain. They are not recorded in the collection’s accession inventories, and the only evidence is an oval ink stamp on the reverse of each item, with an imperial shield and crown in the center, surrounded by the legend “KUPFERSTICH=SAMMLUNG DER KONIGL: MUSEEN”; this corresponds to a stamp in Frits Lugt’s reference work <em>Marques de collections,</em> no. 1606.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fnref59\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">59</a></sup> The stamp is generally found on works acquired by the Kupferstichkabinett, founded in 1831, as part of its foundation collections and acquisitions of the first few decades. Its successor, Lugt no. 1607, was certainly in use by 1881, but unfortunately this does not provide a terminus ante quem for the use of Lugt no. 1606, which continued to be applied at later dates to items that were believed by later curators—rightly or wrongly—to have been early acquisitions; Lugt no. 1606 often appears alongside stamps of private collections that were demonstrably acquired later.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fnref60\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">60</a></sup></p>\n<p>If we tabulate the accession numbers of illuminated cuttings with known dates of acquisition, we see how unreliable the numbers are as a guide to the dates of acquisition of our Bible cuttings. One group, for example, is numbered from Min. 1904 to Min. 1908: they thus fall between Min. 1902, which was acquired in 1856, and Min. 1915, which was acquired in 1835, while a much lower number, Min. 1250, was acquired forty years later, in 1875.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fnref61\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">61</a></sup> While we cannot say for certain, the likelihood is that the Bible cuttings were acquired at an early date. It is probably significant that Wescher, who was usually very careful to record provenance in his 1931 catalog, does not suggest anything for the present cuttings.</p>\n<p>Neither the Getty cutting nor the one in a private collection has a Kupferstichkabinett stamp, and there is no reason to imagine that they ever formed part of the museum collection in Berlin. Nothing is known of the pre-1989 provenance of the cutting in a private collection, but the Getty one has a stamp (Lugt no. 5551) showing that it was owned by Wescher, probably before he moved from Berlin to the US in 1948, where he was employed by J. Paul Getty as the very first curator of the J. Paul Getty Museum, which would eventually become the permanent home of his cutting.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fnref62\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">62</a></sup> Wescher perhaps bought it precisely because he recognized it as a sibling of the group he had cataloged at the Kupferstichkabinett.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We hope to have shown that the Getty-Berlin cuttings come from a large Bible produced in the third quarter of the twelfth century, perhaps in the 1160s, for a French Carthusian house in the orbit of the Grande Chartreuse. A few corrections, additions, and erasures to the cuttings can be found, while some later notes and reading marks by a slightly later hand bear witness to a prolonged, or at least somewhat later, use of the Bible.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fnref63\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">63</a></sup></p>\n<p>The initials were excised from the Bible probably in the first half of the nineteenth century, possibly by Guglielmo Libri in France, or more likely in Germany, where most of them came to light. Many of the cuttings were then acquired by the Kupferstichkabinett, perhaps as early as the 1830s or 1840s, and perhaps in two or three tranches, of which one large group remained forgotten and unaccessioned until 2004. Two others are known, including the one at the Getty Museum, both of which came onto the auction market in the 1980s; it is to be hoped that more emerge as a result of this article bringing them to wider scholarly attention.</p>\n<div class=\"global-accordion-controls\" data-outputs-exclude=\"pdf,epub\">\n  <button class=\"global-accordion-expand-all visually-hidden\">Expand All</button>\n  <button class=\"global-accordion-collapse-all visually-hidden\">Collapse All</button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"appendix\" id=\"#alai-kidd-appendix\" >\n<h2>Appendix</h2>\n<p><em>Descriptions of the Cuttings in Their Probable Original Sequence</em></p>\n<p>Because most of the cuttings are completely unpublished, what follows is a detailed account of their textual contents and the different types of script used.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Format</th>\n<th>Meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Italics</em></td>\n<td>rubrics in red</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"small-caps\">Small caps</span></td>\n<td>majuscules</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span class=\"small-caps\"><em>Small caps in Italics</em></span></td>\n<td>majuscules in color(s)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>[Square brackets]</td>\n<td>missing text</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<section id=\"section-septuagesima\" class=\"accordion-section\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <h3>Septuagesima</h3> <h4>Genesis</h4> <p>18 lines of text, with 15-line foliate illuminated initial, with gold and body-color</p> <p>recto: “<span class=\"small-caps\"><em>Incipit liber Bresit id est Genesis</em>.

In Thomas Kren, <em>French Illuminated Manuscripts in the J. Paul Getty Museum</em> (Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum, 2007), 5, the attribution is “French, ca. 1131–65,” but no explanation is given for these precise dates. The dates may derive from the date given to a copy of the Twelve Minor Prophets with <em>Glossa ordinaria,</em> MS M.962 in the collection of the Morgan Library and Museum in New York, said to be from the Benedictine abbey of Saint Saviour at Anchin in Pecquencourt, whose Abbot Gossuin was in post from ca. 1131–65. The decoration of the Morgan manuscript has little in common with the present cuttings and in fact rather presents counterevidence to Sotheby’s suggestion (see the previous note) that the cuttings may come from Anchin Abbey. <a href=\"#fnref4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Paul Wescher, Beschreibendes Verzeichnis der Miniaturen—Handschriften und Einzelblätter—des Kupferstichkabinetts der Staatlichen Museen Berlin (Leipzig: Weber, 1931), 16–17, Min. 1904–1908, 4678–4684: “Französische Schule (Südostfrankreich), 1. halfte 12.

I use two relatively untapped sources: the photographs of French traveler Jane Dieulafoy (1851–1916) and the account of Qajar statesman E‘temad al-Saltaneh (1843–96). Reading these sources in tandem paints a robust picture of Varamin when it was becoming known for luster tilework and its Emamzadeh Yahya tomb complex was being steadily plundered. While our travelers captured a seminal moment in Varamin’s history, this study ultimately moves beyond their frames and encourages a present-day appreciation of the city’s still standing monuments.","content":"<p>A highlight of the exhibition <em>Persia: Ancient Iran and the Classical World</em> held in 2022 at the Getty Villa was two panels of colorful glazed bricks from the palace of Darius I (r. 522–486 BCE) at Susa. Both panels were borrowed from the Musée du Louvre, and the example depicting a royal archer ended up in Paris because of the amateur photographer Jane Dieulafoy (1851–1916).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> In 1881–82, Jane and her husband, Marcel, spent a year traveling around Iran, and in 1884, Nasir al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848–96) granted them permission to excavate Susa, which unfolded over two seasons in 1885–86.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Wooden crates filled with glazed bricks were soon transported to Paris and entered the Department of Oriental Antiquities, at whose 1888 inauguration Jane received the cross of the Légion d’Honneur.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> While Susa bricks flooded the Louvre, another form of Persian architectural revetment steadily entered French collections. Luster tiles dating to the first half of the thirteenth century and the Ilkhanid period (1256–1353) were also sourced from archaeological excavations but more commonly taken off the walls of still-standing buildings. One such site was the Emamzadeh Yahya (1260–1307) at Varamin, a tomb complex that the Dieulafoys visited just two months into their trip.</p>\n<p>This article explores Jane Dieulafoy’s photographic documentation of the Emamzadeh Yahya and Varamin’s other historical monuments during the couple’s weeklong stay in the village in June 1881. To date, scholars of Iran have relied heavily on the woodcut prints after Dieulafoy’s photographs reproduced in her well-known travelogue <em>La Perse, la Chaldée et la Susiane: Relation de voyage contenant 336 gravures sur bois d’après les photographies de l’auteur et deux cortes</em> (1887).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> In French photography circles, her photographs were largely presumed lost until their inclusion in the 2015–16 exhibition <em>Qui a peur des femmes photographes? 1839–1945</em> (Who is afraid of women photographers? 1839–1919) at the Musée de l’Orangerie.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> Thanks to recent (2021) digitization efforts at the Institut National d’Histoire de l’Art (INHA), Dieulafoy’s photographs can now be studied on the pages of her six personal photography albums.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> The result is a seismic shift in her work’s viability as a source for many fields of Iranian studies, for her photographs omit the creative liberties of the later woodcuts and often outnumber what was reproduced in the travelogue.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> The Varamin section of <em>La Perse</em> features ten prints, for example, whereas “Perse 1” (1881) preserves twenty-eight photographs, meaning nearly triple the archive.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> While this essay focuses on Dieulafoy’s photographs of Varamin, it is anticipated that pre-Islamicists will conduct comparable work on Susa and specialists of Orientalist photography will reevaluate Dieulafoy’s depictions of women. One of the best known and most insidious prints in <em>La Perse</em> depicts a half-dressed “Ziba Khanoum,” an elite woman of Isfahan. The only known comparable photograph taken by Dieulafoy shows the subject fully dressed and calls into question any use of the phrase “after the photographs” (<em>après les photographies</em>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>Bearing in mind that Dieulafoy was traveling in Iran for the first time in 1881, had no formal training or expertise in Iranian studies or Persian art, and retained many of the biases of European (<em>farangi</em>) travelers of the day, I explore her photographs of Varamin (June 1881) in relation to the slightly earlier Persian account (December 1876) of Mohammad Hasan Khan E‘temad al-Saltaneh (1843–96), a Qajar historian and favorite dragoman of Nasir al-Din Shah.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> E‘temad al-Saltaneh accompanied the shah on his internal travels and three European tours (1873, 1878, and 1889) and was a prolific writer.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> Early on his career, during the 1870s, he served as the head of the state press office and directed the government newspapers <em>Ruznameh-ye Iran</em> and <em>Ruznama-ye Dowlati.</em> His account of Varamin—“Tarikh va Joghrafia-ye Varamin (ya Shekar-e Masileh)” (The history and geography of Varamin, or hunting Masileh) was originally published in <em>Ruznameh-ye Iran</em> on 7 Dhu al-Hijjah 1293 AH/23 December 1876, just twelve days after he left Varamin. It was recently included in a collection of his lesser-known works—the <em>Rasa’el-e E‘temad al-Saltaneh</em>—and is therefore relatively untapped as a resource, like Dieulafoy’s photographs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reading E‘temad al-Saltaneh and Dieulafoy in tandem paints a robust picture of Varamin at precisely the moment when it was becoming known for its luster tilework (Persian: <em>zarrinfam</em>; French: <em>faïences à reflets métalliques</em>), a twice-fired ceramic technique incorporating metallic oxides that reached the height of its production between 1180 and 1350. This sparkling revetment once covered the interior of the tomb of Emamzadeh Yahya but was steadily stolen during the second half of the nineteenth century and exported to European cities such as Paris and London. Both E‘temad al-Saltaneh and Dieulafoy visited the tomb during this critical period, but their accounts differ dramatically in their expertise, emphases, and value. While the Qajar historian excelled in geographical analysis, recording measurements, and reading epigraphy, the French traveler took a series of unmatched photographs, including the best view of the complex before its renovation and the only known image of its exceptional luster mihrab in situ. These photographs have not only advanced scholarly understanding of the living sacred complex but also prompted a reevaluation of the display of the tomb’s tiles in more than forty museums worldwide.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Introduction to Jane Dieulafoy: The photography album “Perse 1” and travelogue <em>La Perse</em></h2>\n<p>The Dieulafoys’ first visit to what they called “La Perse, la Chaldée et la Susiane” (corresponding to Iran, southern Iraq, and Susa) lasted from February 1881 to February 1882 and took them from Azerbaijan in the northwest to Susa in the south.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup> The pair had traveled previously in Spain, Morocco, and Egypt, and Marcel had served as the architect in charge of historical monuments in Toulouse (1871–79). They carried a letter from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs but were effectively on their own. In advance of the trip, Jane Dieulafoy studied photography in Paris, and her equipment included cameras, chemicals, albumen papers, and glass plates negatives, all carried by horse across rugged terrain.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> Gelatin dry plates were in wide circulation by 1880, and Dieulafoy could store these negatives and develop them via contact printing when it suited. In addition to being a budding photographer, Dieulafoy was an avid writer, and like E‘temad al-Saltaneh, she first published her account of Varamin in a newspaper, in this case the January 1883 issue of <em>Le tour du monde.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> She continued to publish in <em>Le tour</em> through 1886 and ultimately compiled these articles into her better-known and more exclusive <em>La Perse</em>.</p>\n<p>While Dieulafoy’s <em>Le tour</em> articles were accessible to France’s general public and <em>La Perse</em> to privileged elites, her photographs remained largely hidden from view until INHA’s recent release of her six albums (Perse 1–6) cumulatively containing more than nine hundred photographs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup> This essay focuses exclusively on “Perse 1,” which covers the first few months of the 1881–82 trip: Marand (April), Tabriz, Soltaniyya, Qazvin, Tehran (June), Varamin, back to Tehran, Saveh (July), Qom, Kashan (August), and Isfahan, which continues into the next album. “Perse 1” is a chronological memento of the couple’s journey and distinguished by its personal, dialectical, and working nature and dynamic mixing of landscapes, buildings, and human subjects (<a href=\"#fig-3-1\">fig. 1</a>). Most of the prints are small (around 6.35 × 10.16 centimeters) and lack captions and borders, save for the vignettes of Dieulafoy’s wide lens. There are often two to four prints mounted on a page in a scrapbook manner, and she sometimes placed two similar prints side by side, or even two prints from the same negative.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup> She stitched together her panoramas, and some seemingly cohesive prints are in fact collages.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-01.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 1. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>View of Jane Dieulafoy’s photography album “Perse 1,” pp. 34–35, March 2022, showing photographs taken in Khorramdareh and Qazvin in May 1881.</strong> On the right page is the domed tomb of the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Shazdeh+Hossein/@36.2572276,49.9983629,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ff35520604a07c1:0x697017425b8b87a2!8m2!3d36.2572363!4d50.0005295\" target=\"_blank\">Emamzadeh Shahzadeh Hossein</a> at Qazvin (975–1008 AH/1568–1600).

Photograph by the author</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>The majority of prints in “Perse 1” are Dieulafoy’s photographs, but the album also includes some professional images that she collected. Her portraits of the shah’s nieces and nephews, which he requested she take after their brief audience on 7 June 1881, were mounted across from two professional photographs of Qajar officials.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> The page before contains four professional photographs of Nasir al-Din Shah.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup> The small red <em>D</em> impressed on the prints is therefore indicative of her ownership, not necessarily her authorship.</p>\n<p>Dieulafoy’s modus operandi was to document every step of the journey, and as such, her photographs vary in quality. A comparison of her approach to the congregational mosque (<em>masjed-e jame‘</em>) of Qazvin, one of the oldest mosques of Iran, to that of the Qajar court photographer ‘Abdollah Mirza Qajar (1850–1909) is illuminating. This was Dieulafoy’s first substantive experience of a living congregational mosque in Iran, and she took seven photographs of the site. The north <em>ayvan</em>/portal topped by two minarets (facing the domed sanctuary on the south) was selected as the representative view in her travelogue, but the woodcut altered and enhanced the photograph in several ways.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> Two figures were added to the foreground, and areas of deep shadow were lightened. ‘Abdollah Qajar positioned his camera in the same area looking toward the north portal, but the comparisons end there. His extremely crisp and evenly lit image captures many features lost in Dieulafoy’s shadows and is one of the most beautiful nineteenth-century photographs of the mosque.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup></p>\n<p>Dieulafoy’s preference for quantity over quality exemplifies her approach to architectural photography. One of the most famous monuments photographed by her and many others was the tomb of the Ilkhanid ruler Oljaytu (r. 1304–17) at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dome+of+Soltanieh/@36.4339545,48.794911,276m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x3ff5d5a912e5cc19:0x9827476f70c00e24!2sDome+of+Soltanieh!8m2!3d36.4339911!4d48.7958803!3m4!1s0x3ff5d5a912e5cc19:0x9827476f70c00e24!8m2!3d36.4339911!4d48.7958803\" target=\"_blank\">Soltaniyya</a>. “Perse 1” includes eight photographs of the tomb across three pages, proceeding from general views, to details of the exterior, to a single view of the interior.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup> In the last, she stood in the upper story and looked down toward a tiny figure by the entrance, unobstructed by the scaffolding that currently engulfs the space. The GRI’s album of photographs by the Italian colonel Luigi Pesce includes a single general view of the ruler’s tomb mounted in a shimmering border and identified by a misleading caption: “Grande Moschea in ruina a Sultanie” (Great mosque in ruins at Soltaniyya).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> This monumental view was included in many formal albums of the day, many of which were presented as gifts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup> In her personal album, Dieulafoy had no interest in beautiful borders and captions, often went beyond the singular facade shot, and included her local interlocutors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup></p>\n<p>While Dieulafoy’s architectural photographs are often refreshing to the art historian for their scope, detail, and generally unfiltered nature, the text of her later travelogue can pose problems. She sometimes made historical errors, but more problematic is her bias and stereotyping, including tirades against mollahs and superstition, and a frequent use of the words “fanaticism” and “infidels.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup> Much of <em>La Perse</em> is sprinkled with Dieulafoy’s encounters with Islam and struggles to gain access into religious sites, and her early visit to Qazvin (“Kazbin,” 10–13 May) is a case in point. The couple wanted to visit the aforementioned congregational mosque, but they were refused entry, so they sought an audience with the governor, the brother of the shah.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup> When they asked for his assistance, he replied that he had no authority in the matter and had not visited the mosque in months. The next day, the guardian of the city’s grand hotel offered to take the couple into the mosque between prayers. Their “protector” (<em>protecteur</em>) was successful, and the couple spent more than an hour and a half walking through the building, she taking her seven photographs.</p>\n<p>In Qazvin, Dieulafoy was also introduced to Twelver Shi‘ism, the majority form of Islam practiced in Iran that hinges on devotion to the Prophet Mohammad’s bloodline and considers the Twelve Imams his rightful successors. She first observed a passion play (<em>ta‘ziyeh</em>) in the street recreating the martyrdom of Imam Hossein (626–80), the third Imam, at Karbala. She took two photographs, and one was reproduced in <em>La Perse</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup> She then proceeded to the Emamzadeh Shahzadeh Hossein (975–1008 AH/1568–1600), the tomb complex of a young son of Imam Reza (766–818), the eighth Imam (the term <em>emamzadeh</em> refers to a descendant of one of the Twelve Imams and also the tomb of such a person). The tomb is set in a walled courtyard that doubles as a cemetery, and Dieulafoy observed women chatting and eating sweets, mourning at the graves of loved ones, and donning the chador (a loose cloth, often black, engulfing the body). This scene was captured in her general view of the tomb, which must have been taken from atop the entrance portal (see <a href=\"#fig-3-1\">fig. 1</a>, right page).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup></p>\n<p>Dieulafoy was surprised when a cleric invited her into the tomb, and what follows in <em>La Perse</em> is her description of pilgrimage (<em>ziyarat</em>), or pious visitation. The most sacred element of any Iranian <em>emamzadeh</em> past or present is the cenotaph of the deceased, and this example was enclosed in a three-dimensional pierced screen (<em>zarih</em>). Dieulafoy observed pilgrims tying pieces of cloth to the screen, tapping their foreheads against its corner bosses, and circumambulating it three times. The tomb’s mihrab was covered by a piece of cloth lifted to reveal a painting of a man who she presumed to be the Prophet Mohammad. She concluded, “It is very rare to find him in a mosque, the Muslim religion prohibiting the reproduction of the human figure.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup> This statement underscores Dieulafoy’s amateurism on two levels. First, the space in question was/is most accurately defined as a tomb, not a mosque, and specifically an <em>emamzadeh</em>, a tomb of a descendant of one of the Twelve Imams. Second, there is no outright prohibition against figural imagery in Islam, and in certain times and places, religious subjects were, and still are, depicted in figural form.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup> Portraits of the Twelve Imams were especially common in Qajar Iran (Twelver Shi‘ism being the state religion since 1501), and it is more likely that the painting in the mihrab portrayed one of the Imams, although portraits of the Prophet are known in Iranian tombs.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup> At the end of her visit, Dieulafoy was invited to sit down with a <em>mojtahed</em> (senior theologian), and his education would fill over three pages of <em>La Perse</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">35</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Reading and Seeing Varamin: E‘temad al-Saltaneh and Jane Dieulafoy</h2>\n<p>During the Ilkhanid period, Varamin emerged as an important provincial capital and center of trade, scholarship, and Twelver Shiism.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup> By the Qajar period, the once thriving medieval city had reverted to an agricultural village, but its proximity to Tehran ensured a steady stream of visitation. Among the most important early visitors were Russian consul Alexander Chodzko, who visited in April 1835, and the Qajar statesman ‘Aliqoli Mirza E‘tezad al-Saltaneh, who led a delegation in February 1863.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fnref37\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">37</a></sup> During the 1860s and 1870s, Qajar court photographers like the aforementioned ‘Abdollah Qajar documented a variety of expeditions, and it is possible that the 1863 (E‘tezad al-Saltaneh) and 1876 (E‘temad al-Saltaneh) visits to Varamin could have included a photographer.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fnref38\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">38</a></sup> In the current absence of Qajar court photography of the village, Dieulafoy’s photographs fill a significant gap while visualizing many details described by E‘temad al-Saltaneh, especially epigraphy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fnref39\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">39</a></sup> Their combined archive is critical to the art historian, because it illuminates the conditions of Varamin’s monuments before many were radically transformed.</p>\n<p>Nineteenth-century Varamin was strategically located between the Qajar capital of Tehran to the north and one of the court’s favorite hunting grounds—Masileh—in the Great Salt Desert (Dasht-e Kavir) to the south.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fnref40\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">40</a></sup> The first major destination on the road south from Tehran was Rayy, one of the oldest cites of Iran and home to the twelfth-century Toghrol Tower, which was photographed twice by Dieulafoy and opens the chapter in question in <em>La Perse</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fnref41\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">41</a></sup> The Dieulafoys passed by several Zoroastrian cemeteries (<em>dakhmeh,</em> or “tower of silence”), and she also described the gold dome of the Shrine of ‘Abdolazem (‘Abd al-‘Azem al-Hasani), the most significant holy site near the capital.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fnref42\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">42</a></sup> When they were about three “farsakhs” (<em>farsang</em>s*,* one unit of which is equal to about four miles) from Tehran, the landscape changed dramatically, and lines of “kanots” (qanats, or underground water channels) descended into plains yellowed by wheat and filled with the sounds of harvesting, dogs, horses, and cicadas.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fnref43\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">43</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Dieulafoys spent an entire week in Varamin (June 15–21), and it left a sizeable impression on Jane, resulting in twenty-eight photographs in her personal album and ten woodcuts in her published travelogue. The couple was hosted by the head of the village (<em>kadkhoda</em>), thanks to the arrangements of Joseph-Désiré Tholozan, Nasir al-Din Shah’s physician. The <em>kadkhoda</em>’s house included a courtyard with a <em>talar</em> (porch) and served as the venue for local court. It was from the rooftop of this house that Dieulafoy took her general view of Varamin before watching the sky turn purple as a “violent” sandstorm approached from the desert (<a href=\"#fig-3-2-a\">fig. 2a</a>, upper left; <a href=\"#fig-3-2-b\">2b</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fnref44\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">44</a></sup> In the foreground are the village’s mudbrick houses, and in the background is the tomb tower of ‘Alaoddin (‘Ala’ al-Din, 688 AH/1289).</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-3-2-a\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-2-a\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-02-a.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-2-a\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 2a. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Jane Dieulafoy (French, 1851–1916).</strong> The first spread of Varamin photographs in Dieulafoy’s photography album “Perse 1,” June 1881, pp. 56–57.

The Varamin mosque is the only surviving congregational mosque from the Ilkhanid period in the classic four-<em>ayvan</em> plan.</p>\n<p>One of the strengths of E‘temad al-Saltaneh’s account is his careful analysis of architectural epigraphy, which required the reading of Persian and Arabic inscriptions written in a variety of calligraphic scripts and media.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fnref56\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">56</a></sup> At the mosque, he began with the tiled foundation inscription on the entrance portal, which recorded the name of the patron Mohammad b.

He identifies the Kufic inscription wrapping the top of the tower as the Throne Verse (Ayat al-Kursi, Qur’an 2:255) but neglects to mention the detailed foundation inscription naming the deceased and dated 688 AH/1289–90.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fnref65\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">65</a></sup> The patron, Fakhroddin Hasan (Fakhr al-Din, d. 1308), was the local ruler (<em>malek</em>) of the province of Rayy and Varamin and enjoyed an excellent reputation in Ilkhanid circles. He built the tomb for his father ‘Alaoddin and would soon patronize the Emamzadeh Yahya. Had E‘temad al-Saltaneh read the foundation inscription, he would not have speculated about the deceased’s identity, but when looking at Dieulafoy’s three photographs (see <a href=\"#fig-3-3-a\">fig. 3a</a>, right), we can appreciate the challenge of reading an inscription that was not only located high up the tower but also rendered in an almost illegible script weaving in and out of its thirty-two flanges. It was only in the early twentieth century that the foundation inscription was recorded, providing the basis for Sheila Blair’s recent analysis.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fnref66\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">66</a></sup></p>\n<p>To the east of the citadel was a tall building in ruins (<em>makhrubeh</em>) said to be the tomb of Shah Hossein.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fnref67\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">67</a></sup> A tiled mihrab was one of the remains (<em>baqi</em>) of the adjacent mosque, and E‘temad al-Saltaneh identifies its inscription as “al-Sakinah” (Tranquility), in reference to Qur’an 48:4.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fnref68\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">68</a></sup> In his 1955 book, which recorded his 1939 and 1943 visits, American art historian Donald Wilber described the mihrab as enclosed in a new prayer hall and referred back to Dieulafoy’s two “drawings” of the site in <em>La Perse.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fnref69\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">69</a></sup> In “Perse 1,” she mounted her three original photographs on a single page (<a href=\"#fig-3-6\">fig. 6</a>). On the left are two views of the octagonal tomb tower. The roof is missing and populated by birds’ nests, but we can still discern the fine brickwork. On the right is the mihrab described above and one of Dieulafoy’s most arresting photographs: A man leans against the inside of the niche, engulfed by the hood above; a mule stands to the right; and a small child sits precariously on the high wall behind, next to other onlookers. The mihrab’s massive muqarnas hood recalls Seljuk Anatolian examples, and it is framed by a border of inscribed square tiles, only the top row of which is intact.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fnref70\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">70</a></sup> When zooming in on Dieulafoy’s sharp photograph, the viewer can see the word <em>al-sakinah</em> on the first surviving tile on the upper right. The cropped and simplified woodcut in <em>La Perse</em> is a poor substitute but would have a lasting legacy in Varamin, as I will discuss below.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn71\" id=\"fnref71\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">71</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-06.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-6\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 6. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Jane Dieulafoy (French, 1851–1916).</strong> Views of the Emamzadeh Shah Hossein (early 1300s) at Varamin from Dieulafoy’s photography album “Perse 1,” June 1881, p. 64.

Wilber took five photographs of the mihrab, including details of its elaborate strapwork, but by this time, the inscribed tiles documented by E‘temad al-Saltaneh and Dieulafoy were mostly gone.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn72\" id=\"fnref72\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">72</a></sup> Today, the site has fared the worst of Varamin’s Ilkhanid monuments. A report published in 2016 describes the encroachment of new construction and destruction of historical features, and the mihrab is below ground level and screened by a metal frame.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fnref73\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">73</a></sup></p>\n<h2>“The Most Celebrated Building of the World”: The Emamzadeh Yahya in the Field</h2>\n<p>The Emamzadeh Yahya was the farthest site from both the medieval city of Varamin (by the congregational mosque) and the nineteenth-century village (by the tomb tower of ‘Alaoddin), but it nonetheless received the most attention and praise from our travelers (see <a href=\"#fig-3-4\">fig. 4</a>). E‘temad al-Saltaneh concluded, “Due to the prestige of its tilework, we can say that it is the most celebrated [lit. first] building of the world.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn74\" id=\"fnref74\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">74</a></sup> Dieulafoy described it as “one of the most interesting monuments in the country” and further maintained: “It is not possible to find enamels more pure and more brilliant than those of the Emamzadeh Yahya.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn75\" id=\"fnref75\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">75</a></sup> They were both referring to the tomb’s luster tilework, which comprised the cenotaph, mihrab, and dado.</p>\n<p>All of the Emamzadeh Yahya’s luster revetment was incrementally stripped from the tomb between the 1870s and 1898 and primarily exported abroad. The mihrab signed by ‘Ali b. Mohammad b.

Dieulafoy’s photograph of the site has long been known through its woodcut version in <em>La Perse</em>, which in turn served as Wilber’s guide for the reconstruction of its Ilkhanid-period plan (<a href=\"#fig-3-8\">fig. 8</a>, upper right).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn81\" id=\"fnref81\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">81</a></sup> The complex was originally fronted by a monumental entrance portal; to the east was a conical tower; and at the south was the main tomb capped by a stepped dome. As always, Dieulafoy’s photograph is a much stronger resource than the woodcut, and we can now appreciate the portal’s decorative brickwork, note some damages to the conical dome, and discern details of the complex’s crumbling walls. The only known comparable photograph was taken by German art historian Friedrich Sarre around 1897 and is far darker and blurrier.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn82\" id=\"fnref82\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">82</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-08.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-8\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 8. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Jane Dieulafoy (French, 1851–1916).</strong> Views of Varamin from Dieulafoy’s photography album “Perse 1,” June 1881, p. 65.

We are exempted from the ban, the shah having agreed, in the interest of Marcel’s studies, to authorize us to cross the threshold of the sanctuary. On seeing the royal order, the ketkhoda [<em>kadkhoda</em>] ordered his brother to accompany us; his presence was not useless. When we arrived, the guarding of the gate was entrusted to peasants armed with sticks, surrounding a mullah wearing a white turban reserved for priests.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn83\" id=\"fnref83\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">83</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A portrait of these supposedly threatening “peasants” and mullah is mounted next to Dieulafoy’s general view of the shrine (see <a href=\"#fig-3-8\">fig. 8</a>, far left), and we can imagine the subjects’ potential displeasure on two levels: having to grant the couple entry and being subjected to her voyeuristic lens.</p>\n<p>Dieulafoy took two photographs inside the relatively small tomb measuring about 9 meters across and ultimately stacked and slightly overlapped the prints in “Perse 1” (<a href=\"#fig-3-9\">fig. 9</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn84\" id=\"fnref84\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">84</a></sup> The upper photograph is the only known image of the luster mihrab in situ and one of the most valuable photographs in “Perse 1.” The mihrab, in turn, is a very important subject, and one of just nine known examples of its kind. Six are relatively intact in museums—three in Mashhad and one each in Tehran, Berlin, and Honolulu (the Emamzadeh Yahya example)—and three are dispersed and require virtual reconstruction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn85\" id=\"fnref85\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">85</a></sup> Dieulafoy stood slightly to the left of the enormous mihrab and captured it perfectly framed by a stucco inscription and topped by an additional stucco panel. Her lower photograph focuses on the squinch to the mihrab’s immediate left, which was decorated with fine panels of stucco. A recent photograph of the mihrab void and adjacent corner niche effectively combines the views shown in Dieulafoy’s two photographs and gives a fuller perspective of the intimate space (<a href=\"#fig-3-10\">fig. 10</a>).

The mihrab was framed not only by the surviving later stucco inscription dated Muharram 707 AH/July 1307 (forty-two years after the mihrab’s date) but also two smaller borders, one of which was composed of luster half stars and half crosses. During the mihrab’s afterlife on the market (ca. 1898–1940), some of its more than sixty tiles were lost, which led Sheila Blair to conclude, “The proportions and layout are slightly odd, and there must have been a horizontal band on top of the second niche connecting the two vertical bands with jumbled sections of Qurʼān 2:255–56.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn87\" id=\"fnref87\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">87</a></sup> Indeed, this now-lost band is visible in Dieulafoy’s photograph (<a href=\"#fig-3-11\">fig. 11</a>).</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3-11\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-11\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-11.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-11\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 11. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Annotation of Jane Dieulafoy’s 1881 photograph of the Emamzadeh Yahya’s luster mihrab in situ (“Perse 1,” p. 66).</strong> Yellow elements are carved stucco, and black is luster tilework.

Annotations by the author.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Some of the mihrab’s outer border tiles were jumbled during its life in Honolulu (since 1941), and thanks to Dieulafoy’s photograph, we can now read Qur’an 62:1–5 in the correct order and consider these verses in relation to the same ones (62:1–4) in the framing stucco inscription (see <a href=\"#fig-3-11\">fig. 11</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn88\" id=\"fnref88\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">88</a></sup> These verses concerning God, His Messenger, and His Sacred Book were clearly very important to the denizens of Ilkhanid Varamin. They were selected not only for the Emamzadeh Yahya’s luster mihrab (663 AH/1265) and stucco frieze (707 AH/1307) but also for the stucco band (see <a href=\"#fig-3-3\">fig. 3</a>, left page, upper right) wrapping the sanctuary of the city’s congregational mosque (722–26 AH/1322–26). In the Emamzadeh Yahya, these verses transition into the dated foundation inscription naming Fakhroddin Hasan (the same patron as the ‘Alaoddin tower) and a hadith in honor of the Prophet Mohammad’s grandfather, all of which were read by E‘temad al-Saltaneh.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn89\" id=\"fnref89\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">89</a></sup></p>\n<p>In addition to leaving us with a priceless view of the luster mihrab in situ, Dieulafoy also captured the tomb’s living sanctity and furnishings. The lower half of the mihrab is obstructed by a geometric screen, and metal vases with flared rims sit on its visible corners (see <a href=\"#fig-3-9\">fig. 9</a>, upper image).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn90\" id=\"fnref90\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">90</a></sup> A string above suspends several votive offerings (<em>nazr</em>), likely metal lamps, vases, and birds.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn91\" id=\"fnref91\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">91</a></sup> Considered together, these features reveal that the tomb was a living sacred space in 1881, despite the poor condition of some parts of the complex, including the entrance portal. This assertion is supported by Dieulafoy’s aforementioned photograph of the mullah and guards (see <a href=\"#fig-3-8\">fig. 8</a>, far left) and E‘temad al-Saltaneh’s encounter with the tomb’s guardian (<em>motevalli</em>), who shared that the saint was a son of Imam Musa, the seventh Imam.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn92\" id=\"fnref92\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">92</a></sup></p>\n<p>The screen in front of the mihrab poses some interpretive conundrums but likely attests the fluid and jeopardized nature of the interior. E‘temad al-Saltaneh describes a wood <em>marqad</em> (tomb or grave) in the middle of the tomb measuring 1.75 by 3.25 <em>zar‘</em> (cubits), or 1.82 by 3.38 meters (5.97 × 11.09 ft).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn93\" id=\"fnref93\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">93</a></sup> Given this substantial size, which was roughly one third of the tomb’s total diameter (about 9 m), he was likely referring to the screen that shielded the cenotaph, versus the cenotaph itself.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn94\" id=\"fnref94\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">94</a></sup> By 1881, this screen could have been resized and pushed against the qibla wall for a double function: to serve as the sacred threshold between the pilgrim and deceased (the cenotaph) and to protect the mihrab from theft.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn95\" id=\"fnref95\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">95</a></sup> While the former was the screen’s conventional role, the latter would have been precipitated by the steady stealing of the tomb’s luster tilework, and such a screen-cenotaph-mihrab combination is not unknown.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn96\" id=\"fnref96\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">96</a></sup> The ex-votos captured by Dieulafoy further imply the cenotaph’s presence behind the screen, because, as the symbol of the deceased, the cenotaph would have been the focus of such offerings. A photograph taken in 1958 appears to capture the same screen bedecked in votives, including calligraphic drawings of birds (basmala birds), prayer tablets, and flags (<a href=\"#fig-3-12\">fig. 12</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn97\" id=\"fnref97\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">97</a></sup> An elaborate metal ‘<em>alam</em> (ceremonial standard) rests against the screen, and a few vessels seem to sit on top of the cenotaph behind.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn98\" id=\"fnref98\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">98</a></sup> Still further behind, the mihrab is now but a looming void.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3-12\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-12\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-12.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-12\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 12. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>A large ceremonial standard (<em>‘alam</em>) and votives affixed to the screen in front of the mihrab void in the Emamzadeh Yahya at Varamin, April 1958.</strong> Photograph dated on the reverse and stamped “U.

He had only seen one of its kind in an <em>emamzadeh</em> in Qom, in reference to the 734 AH/1334 example from the Emamzadeh ‘Ali b. Ja‘far now in the Islamic Museum of Tehran’s National Museum complex.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn99\" id=\"fnref99\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">99</a></sup> He presumably spent a good amount of time inspecting the Emamzadeh Yahya’s mihrab, because he identified the majority of its twelve sets of Qur’anic inscriptions (see <a href=\"#fig-3-11\">fig. 11</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn100\" id=\"fnref100\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">100</a></sup> The easiest to read were those in large blue letters in relief in either <em>sols</em> (thuluth) or Kufic (see the outer border and two triangular hoods). Far more difficult were those painted in luster in <em>naskh</em> script in one-inch bands on either side of the four columns. E‘temad al-Saltaneh identified the inscriptions by their chapter titles (for example, sura Hamd, or al-Fatiha, in reference to the first chapter) and common names (for example, Ayat al-Kursi, or 2:255) and provided the spread of verses when necessary. He also transcribed the signature and date panel at the bottom of the mihrab.</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting sections of E‘temad al-Saltaneh’s account concerns his reading of two luster tiles from the dado. He describes these stars as separated from the wall (“az divar seva shodeh”) and conceivably could have held them in his hands, rotating them as he read their small perimeter inscriptions in <em>naskh</em> (for their scale, see <a href=\"#fig-3-7\">fig. 7</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn101\" id=\"fnref101\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">101</a></sup> The first was inscribed with verses 78 and 79 of sura al-Isra (chapter 17), concerning the performance of prayer. The only tile currently known to carry these verses is in the Musée du Louvre and features verses 78–79 on one side and 80–81 on the other.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn102\" id=\"fnref102\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">102</a></sup> The second tile was inscribed with a common combination of verses—sura Hamd and sura al-Ikhlas (112:1–4)—and one of many examples is today in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn103\" id=\"fnref103\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">103</a></sup> The Louvre tile was donated by Jules Maciet in 1888, and the Metropolitan star by Edward C. Moore in 1891, but the shrine’s stars and crosses had begun entering museums a decade earlier. The South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum [V&amp;A]) acquired its first batch of Emamzadeh Yahya tiles in 1875, and the Musée National de Céramique at Sèvres received its first in March 1880 via the diplomat Emile Bernay.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn104\" id=\"fnref104\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">104</a></sup> E‘temad al-Saltaneh’s reading of the tomb’s tiles in situ, yet off the wall, therefore coincided exactly with their steady removal and export. This begs the question of any potential involvement in their dispersal, and the same must be asked of the Dieulafoys.</p>\n<h2>“All Is Fish That Comes to the Net:” The Emamzadeh Yahya on the Market</h2>\n<p>The Antoin Sevruguin photographs of Persia collection at the GRI includes a rare photograph of luster ceramics on display in Tehran shortly after our travelers’ visits to Varamin (<a href=\"#fig-3-13\">fig. 13</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn105\" id=\"fnref105\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">105</a></sup> Captioned “Cachis persans (Téhéran)” (“cachis” for <em>kashi,</em> or tiles), the subject is a tall cabinet with five shelves packed with four types of luster: medieval Kashani tiles, including large stars and crosses that can be attributed to the Emamzadeh Yahya and must have been recently removed; Safavid (1501–1722) vessels with metal fittings; contemporary Qajar tiles, some imitating Ilkhanid models; and, most remarkably given the location in Iran, large chargers made in Manises, Valencia, around 1400 and then referred to as “Hispano-Moresque.” The cabinet’s mixed curation of luster objects and tiles from Spain to Iran over seven centuries echoed contemporary trends in Europe. In the catalog of the Frédéric Spitzer sale held in Paris in 1893, for example, eleven Spanish luster vessels were reproduced directly above three sets of Ilkhanid luster tiles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn106\" id=\"fnref106\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">106</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3-13\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-13\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-13.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-13\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 13. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Interior of a Tehran house with a luster cabinet captioned “Cachis persans (Téhéran)” (Persian tiles [Tehran]), ca. 1880s.</strong> Photograph by Antoin Sevruguin (ca. 1851–1933), albumen print.

One such individual was the Frenchman Jules Richard (1816–91), who taught photography at the Dar al-Fonun (polytechnic college in Tehran founded in 1851) and is infamous for supplying many museums with medieval luster tiles, especially South Kensington. In his 1883 account of his fifteen-year residence in Iran (1866–81), English physician C. J. Wills describes a visit to Richard’s home that paints a useful backstory to Sevruguin’s photograph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our host was an old Frenchman who held an appointment as instructor in French and translator to the Shah, and was a Mahommedan [Richard had converted]. . . . The Frenchman had a large collection of valuable antiquities, which he showed us, and they were all genuine. That was seventeen years ago [ca. 1866]; now, in a hundred specimens from Persia, be they what they will, ninety are shams. . . . At that time [ca. 1866] the craze for objects of oriental art had not set in, and the big tiles we saw (or bricks) of <em>reflet métallique</em>, with raised inscriptions, were such as one seldom sees nowadays [ca. 1883], save in national collections.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn107\" id=\"fnref107\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">107</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"remove-paragraph-indent\">Later in his account, in his section on pottery, Wills further describes the state of affairs in the 1880s:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The wall tiles now [ca. 1883] so much valued in Europe are seldom seen <em>in situ</em>. Clever imitations are made in Ispahan [Isfahan], but the art of making the metallic (<em>reflet</em>) lustre is gone. Most of the bricks that are not protected, by the fact of being in shrines, have already been stolen, and fear of the consequences of detection is all that protects the rest. All is fish that comes to the net, and the local magnates would sell the big monolith of Yezd [Yazd] marble, which covers the grave of Hafiz [d. 1390, buried in Shiraz], <em>for a price.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn108\" id=\"fnref108\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">108</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wills’s comments capture the major trends of the nineteenth-century (table 1).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn109\" id=\"fnref109\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">109</a></sup> During the 1850s and 1860s, the purveying of luster tilework was led primarily by a small network of Tehran-based Frenchmen.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn110\" id=\"fnref110\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">110</a></sup> In 1858, the director of the Musée National de Céramique at Sèvres instructed Emile Duhousset, an officer involved in training the Qajar army, to research contemporary ceramic production and acquire historical specimens.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn111\" id=\"fnref111\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">111</a></sup> Around the same time, Richard and Jules-Baptiste Nicolas, another Frenchman based in Tehran, began acquiring luster tiles, and in 1867, diplomat Julien de Rochechouart published a travelogue that named specific sites, including the Shrine of Shaykh ‘Abdosamad (‘Abd al-Samad, d. 1299–1300) at Natanz.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn112\" id=\"fnref112\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">112</a></sup> He especially praised the epigraphic frieze tiles in the shrine’s tomb and confessed that he owned a few.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn113\" id=\"fnref113\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">113</a></sup> Some of these tiles ended up in the hands of Richard and Nicolas in Tehran and were sold in 1875 to Robert Murdoch Smith, agent for South Kensington, alongside stars and crosses from the Emamzadeh Yahya.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn114\" id=\"fnref114\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">114</a></sup> As previously mentioned, the Sèvres museum would receive its first batch of Emamzadeh Yahya tiles five years later (1880).</p>\n<p>The Natanz and Varamin tomb shrines were far from the only Iranian sites plundered for their luster during the second half of the nineteenth century. Additional targets were <em>emamzadeh</em>s in Qom and Damghan and the Masjed-e Maydan in Kashan.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn115\" id=\"fnref115\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">115</a></sup> The stolen elements included mihrabs, cenotaphs, long epigraphic friezes, and the variously shaped tiles of the dadoes. The easiest way to reimagine these tiled jigsaw puzzles is to walk into the Natanz tomb, whose walls have not been plastered and which capture for posterity the imprints of each removed tile.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn116\" id=\"fnref116\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">116</a></sup></p>\n<p>One of the last luster elements taken from the Emamzadeh Yahya was the mihrab composed of more than sixty tiles. According to Armenian-American dealer and collector Hagop Kevorkian, Mirza Hasan Ashtiani Mostowfi al-Mamalek, the chief state accountant, brought the mihrab to Paris for exhibition in the Exposition Universelle of 1900. As a result, the Mostowfi was “disgraced and degraded” by Mozaffar al-Din Shah (r. 1896–1907) and prohibited from exhibiting or selling the piece.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn117\" id=\"fnref117\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">117</a></sup> It was eventually displayed in a store on the rue du 4 septembre, where it was the focus of pilgrimage by all of the amateur enthusiasts of “Oriental art” in Paris, as described by French collector and author Henry-René d’Allemagne.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn118\" id=\"fnref118\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">118</a></sup> In Paris, it was also photographed by Sarre, who reproduced it in his <em>Denkmäler Persischer Baukunst</em> <strong>(translation TK)</strong> and attributed it to the Emamzadeh Yahya.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn119\" id=\"fnref119\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">119</a></sup> According to Kevorkian, upon the death of the shah, a leading <em>mojtahed</em> of Iran’s Constitutional Revolution (1906–11) authorized the Mostowfi “to dispose of the monument in question.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn120\" id=\"fnref120\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">120</a></sup> In October 1912, Kevorkian traveled to Iran to negotiate the purchase, and his political connections ultimately earned him a good price. He soon sent the following telegram to American industrialist and collector Charles Freer: “Have just secured famous mihrab of lustre tiles of Veramin mosque property of Mostofy Memalik Persian Minister of War . . . now stored in Paris where could be viewed privately . . . pleased give you priority of right of refusal.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn121\" id=\"fnref121\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">121</a></sup></p>\n<p>1913 was a momentous year in the global dissemination of the Emamzadeh Yahya’s tiles, and Paris was a central node. While Kevorkian peddled the mihrab to Freer, Paris-based dealer Clotilde Duffeuty sold the cenotaph panel (see <a href=\"#fig-3-7\">fig. 7</a>) and many stars and crosses to the museum of the Stieglitz Central School of Technical Drawing in Saint Petersburg.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn122\" id=\"fnref122\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">122</a></sup> Concurrently in London, the luster mihrab from the Masjed-e Maydan at Kashan was offered in the <em>Exhibition of Persian Art &amp; Curios: The Collection Formed by J. R. Preece</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn123\" id=\"fnref123\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">123</a></sup> In his telegram to Freer, Kevorkian compared the two luster mihrabs, emphasizing that the Emamzadeh Yahya example was “in far better condition and about twice as large as that of Preece quality infinitely superieur altogether by far finer monument.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn124\" id=\"fnref124\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">124</a></sup></p>\n<p>The theft of the Emamzadeh Yahya’s mihrab marked the end of the shrine’s half century of steady plunder and both conformed to and departed from contemporary trends.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn125\" id=\"fnref125\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">125</a></sup> Unlike many large luster ensembles that were broken up and sold piecemeal, including the Emamzadeh Yahya’s cenotaph and the two mihrabs from the Natanz shrine, the Emamzadeh Yahya’s mihrab was carefully packed and transported for display abroad as a relatively complete unit. If we trust Kevorkian’s account, this was a bold example of removal and export by an Iranian minister, but Hasan Mostowfi was far from the first Qajar official to sell out the country’s luster tilework.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn126\" id=\"fnref126\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">126</a></sup> In the 1870s, the minister Hossein Khan Sepahsalar issued four critical permits facilitating the export of luster tilework bound for South Kensington, including from the Emamzadeh Yahya.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn127\" id=\"fnref127\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">127</a></sup> By the 1880s, large luster tiles were increasingly rare, as observed by Wills, and it is not surprising that the mihrab became a valuable cultural commodity at the Paris exposition. This was also the stage to negotiate the ongoing excavation of Susa, then under the purview of French archaeologist Jacques de Morgan. Just before he left Paris, Mozaffar al-Din signed the third Franco-Persian archaeological convention, which made the French monopoly perpetual and granted all Susa finds to France.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn128\" id=\"fnref128\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">128</a></sup></p>\n<p>While the Dieulafoys were responsible for illegally taking much of Susa to Paris, and their names appear frequently on the Louvre’s labels for the glazed bricks, they played a more indirect role in the global consumption of the Emamzadeh Yahya’s luster tiles. Jane Dieulafoy’s praise of the shrine’s tilework in her first newspaper article and subsequent travelogue undoubtedly amplified its demand, as was the case with Rochechouart’s 1867 travelogue and the Natanz shrine. It is critical to remember, however, that Dieulafoy never reproduced her exceptional photograph of the mihrab in situ during her lifetime. It remained tucked away in her personal album (see <a href=\"#fig-3-9\">fig. 9</a>) while the mihrab itself entered a state of architectural ambiguity on the art market. Despite Sarre’s attribution of the mihrab to the Emamzadeh Yahya in 1910, Kevorkian vaguely described it as from the “Veramin mosque” in his 1913 telegram to Freer.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn129\" id=\"fnref129\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">129</a></sup> The next year, he displayed it in New York and published it as “from the Seljoucid Temple at Veramin.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn130\" id=\"fnref130\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">130</a></sup> In 1931, the mihrab was included in the momentous <em>International Exhibition of Persian Art</em> in London and described as a “mihrab of lustre tiles from a mosque in Kashan.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn131\" id=\"fnref131\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">131</a></sup> Had Dieulafoy reproduced her photograph of the mihrab in her 1880s publications, or had it simply been seen on its distinct qibla in the tomb of Emamzadeh Yahya, its origins might not have been so easily confused or deliberately muddled.</p>\n<p>The anonymity of the Emamzadeh Yahya persists in many museums today. In the V&amp;A’s Ceramics Galleries, a single star tile from the shrine’s dado is included in a large display titled “The Spread of Tin-Glaze and Lustre, 800–1800.” The star tile sits in front of a contemporary Kashani jar, and the two are combined in a label that only lists the shared place of production (Kashan).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn132\" id=\"fnref132\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">132</a></sup> In the same museum’s Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art, a large panel of stars and crosses from the shrine is displayed next to a fifteenth-century luster bowl from Málaga in a matter that recalls the eclectic Tehran cabinet photographed by Sevruguin (see <a href=\"#fig-3-13\">fig. 13</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn133\" id=\"fnref133\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">133</a></sup> This label does provide some architectural context—“from the tomb of a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad at Varamin near Tehran”—but there are many <em>emamzadeh</em>s in Varamin, and the Emamzadeh Yahya could have been named, as it is in the collections records online.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn134\" id=\"fnref134\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">134</a></sup> These two displays represent a fraction of those worldwide, but we can generally observe a prioritization of the luster technique over architectural context. One exception is the bilingual label in the Hermitage’s recently (2022) renovated Iran galleries titled “Tiles from the Imamzadeh Yahya Mausoleum in Varamin” (see <a href=\"#fig-3-7\">fig. 7</a>). The extended label offers substantive information on the tomb’s original luster environment and the tiles’ provenance. The latter section opens with, “The mausoleum gradually fell into decline and was largely destroyed by the middle of the nineteenth century.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn135\" id=\"fnref135\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">135</a></sup> This begs questions about the extent to which the Emamzadeh Yahya was “largely destroyed” and the look of the building today.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: Ruins to Realities</h2>\n<p>In their accounts of Varamin, both E‘temad al-Saltaneh and Dieulafoy describe the village’s historical monuments as ruins, ruined, or remains (Persian: <em>makhrubeh,</em> <em>kharab, baqi</em>; French: <em>ruine</em>). Dieulafoy’s picturesque photographs of lost domes, crumbling <em>ayvan</em>s, and stripped tiles attest some of these grim realities, but Varamin’s monuments were not ruins in the total sense of the word, and their conditions varied considerably. Some had suffered massive structural damage (congregational mosque); others were relatively intact (tomb tower of ‘Alaoddin); and still others remained in use despite areas of dilapidation (Emamzadeh Yahya). In the ensuing century, all of Varamin’s monuments, except for the citadel, would be renovated and restored to varying degrees. Viewers of Dieulafoy’s photographs must therefore avoid indefinite lingering and romanticization and approach them as valuable snapshots in time (1881 to be precise), ultimately moving beyond their frame.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in the decades following Dieulafoy’s visit, the Emamzadeh Yahya underwent profound physical changes. The complex’s original entrance portal and conical tower (see <a href=\"#fig-3-8\">fig. 8</a>, upper right) were progressively lost and/or deliberately demolished, and the tomb was recast as a solitary building and set in the middle of a new rectangular courtyard, as documented by French architect, archaeologist, and museum director André Godard (<a href=\"#fig-3-14\">fig. 14</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn136\" id=\"fnref136\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">136</a></sup> The original domed tomb was ringed by a new perimeter of lower domed rooms and <em>ayvan</em>s (one each on the north and south), and the interior’s stripped dado was clad in rectangular underglaze tiles, many of which also went missing.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn137\" id=\"fnref137\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">137</a></sup> The exact dates of these renovations are unknown, but they likely transpired in the early twentieth century during the Qajar to Pahlavi (1925–79) transition.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3-14\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-14\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/overton-14.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3-14\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 14. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>The Emamzadeh Yahya at Varamin after the major renovation of the early twentieth century, likely early 1930s</strong>.

The Society for National Heritage (Anjoman-e asar-e melli) was founded in 1921, the year of Reza Khan’s coup, and national heritage thereafter became a top priority of an increasingly nationalist state.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn138\" id=\"fnref138\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">138</a></sup> Among the most important early initiatives were the abolition of the French monopoly on excavation (1927), the approval of the Antiquities Law (“Law concerning the preservation of national antiquities,” 3 November 1930), and the founding of the National Museum in Tehran (1934–39, Muzeh-ye Iran Bastan), whose first director was Godard. The Antiquities Law called for the registration of historical monuments through the end of the Zand era (1796), and Varamin’s Ilkhanid sites were registered at the beginning of this process (congregational mosque, registered as no. 176 in 1932; tomb tower of ‘Alaoddin, no. 177, 1932; Emamzadeh Yahya, no. 199, 1933; and Emamzadeh Shah Hossein, no. 339, 1940).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn139\" id=\"fnref139\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">139</a></sup></p>\n<p>While national heritage became a chief prerogative of the Pahlavi state, Kevorkian peddled the Emamzadeh Yahya’s luster mihrab on the global stage. After displaying it in New York (1914) and London (1931) and securing its inclusion in the six-volume <em>A Survey of Persian Art</em> (1938-39), he again displayed it in New York, this time in the momentous <em>Six Thousand Years of Persian Art</em> (1940).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn140\" id=\"fnref140\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">140</a></sup> Shortly after this exhibition, he sold the mihrab to a then-twenty-eight-year-old Doris Duke for the staggering sum of $150,000.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn141\" id=\"fnref141\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">141</a></sup> In a letter to Duke, Kevorkian expressed his “deep satisfaction in the realization that I have transferred the title of this unique monument which I cherished, to one so worthy.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn142\" id=\"fnref142\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">142</a></sup> It is quite something to consider the registration and renovation of the Emamzadeh Yahya on one side of the world and the purveying of its mihrab as a “unique monument” on the other, which ultimately landed it in a private home in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It is equally powerful to consider the relatively contemporary construction of the National Museum in Tehran (1934–37) and that museum’s possession of several Ilkhanid mihrabs, including the luster example seen by E‘temad al-Saltaneh in Qom’s Emamzadeh ‘Ali b. Jafar.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn143\" id=\"fnref143\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">143</a></sup></p>\n<p>Unlike many <em>emamzadeh</em>s in Iran, the Emamzadeh Yahya has successfully resisted encroachment and construction beyond the major renovation of the early twentieth century. Its exceptional Ilkhanid stuccowork can still be appreciated in situ, and the site lives on as a sacred space. The current cenotaph is modestly sized, covered in textiles and ritual objects, and set within the aforementioned hexagonal screen (<em>zarih</em>). The memory of the luster tilework lives on and is symbolized by a tiny fragment of a cross remounted at the top of the mihrab void (see <a href=\"#fig-3-10\">fig. 10</a>). Until recently (2021), Dieulafoy’s <em>La Perse</em> also figured prominently in the mihrab void. Two framed collages (for viewing on each side of the gender-segregated space) displayed two woodcuts from a Persian edition of <em>La Perse</em>: the general view of the Emamzadeh Yahya and the mihrab of the Emamzadeh Shah Hossein, erroneously identified as the mihrab of the Emamzadeh Yahya (see <a href=\"#fig-3-10\">fig. 10</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn144\" id=\"fnref144\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">144</a></sup> Below were two photographs of tiles on display in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, including the cenotaph panel flanked by stars and crosses. At the time of the collage’s production, Dieulafoy’s excellent photographs of both mihrabs (see <a href=\"#fig-3-6\">fig. 6</a>, right; <a href=\"#fig-3-9\">fig. 9</a>, upper) were not known, but today they are accessible to anyone in Varamin with internet access. It remains to be seen if Dieulafoy’s photographs will make a cameo in the Emamzadeh Yahya, like the previous <em>La Perse</em> woodcuts. What is certain is that they are being used by the shrine’s conservators and constitute an important step of knowledge repatriation, generally defined as the return of knowledge, and the sources that drive its production, to original stakeholders.</p>\n<p>Tehranis willing to make the trek to Varamin today (about the distance from West Los Angeles to San Bernadino) are most likely to visit the congregational mosque and tomb tower of ‘Alaoddin. The tower is now a small anthropology museum set in a garden, and it displays a large field camera of the type Dieulafoy would have used. As we have seen, the mosque was in terrible condition during the nineteenth century but rebuilt in the 1990s. Today, it is used for religious ceremonies such as Moharram and Ahya (Laylat al-Qadr, when the first verses of the Qur’an were revealed to the Prophet Mohammad during Ramadan) and is the home of the Varamin branch of the Office of Cultural Heritage. Like the Emamzadeh Yahya, these buildings exemplify the fluid fortunes of medieval sites, and the mosque’s rise from an abandoned ruin to a living building is an important reminder to move beyond the nineteenth-century lens.</p>\n<p>This article has emphasized the importance of nineteenth-century photography for the study of Iran’s medieval monuments while also underscoring the contingent nature of the photograph as a source—contingent on its reproduction (or not), accessibility (or not), and dissemination (or not). It has taken more than 140 years for Dieulafoy’s photographs to become critical resources for the study of Varamin, and the future discovery of additional photographs will likewise reshape the narrative. In the meantime, it is expected that Dieulafoy’s openly accessible photographs will become standard resources in many fields of Iranian architectural history, including Achaemenid Susa, Safavid Isfahan, and Qajar Tehran, as well as critical tools for revisiting <em>La Perse</em> itself.</p>\n<p class=\"grj-contributor-bio\"><strong>Keelan Overton</strong> is an independent scholar based in Santa Barbara, California.</p>\n<h2 class=\"notes-heading\">Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"backmatter\">I am sincerely grateful to Thomas Galifot for alerting me to Dieulafoy’s albums at INHA and Jérôme Delatour and Julie Brunet for supporting ongoing research and reproduction.

Linking E. L. T. Mesens’s propaganda work for the Allied cause to the activities of Polish painters stationed in Baghdad, particularly Józef Czapski (1896–93) and Józef Jarema (1900–1974), and to those of Iraqi artists Jewad Selim (1919–1961) and Jamil Hamoudi (1924–2003), it demonstrates how a consortium of artists and officers came to model a version of modern art construed as free inquiry into form, or “art alone.” Polish artists mobilized propagandistic narratives about threats to civilization, including the loss of Paris as an open city. Responses by Iraqi artists both reflect and refract the Allied version of civilizational values. As such, the Polish-Iraqi encounter represents an early, not-yet-postwar reckoning with doubts about the progression of artistic practice in a world in which barbarous violence was always imminent.","content":"<p>In early February 1943, a date that saw tens of thousands of Polish soldiers congregating in Iraq to train for war, a Polish painter named Josef Jarema published a robust endorsement of the formalist approach to his craft. Having studied in Paris in the late 1920s, he was a committed modernist who embraced color as the primary formal element of his compositions. “Every academicism is a kind of corpse,” he wrote in Polish, “even the Parisian one,” before proceeding to endorse the artistic task of creating a “parallel world” of vivid emotions and sensations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> In many ways, this testimony seems perfectly at home in the 1940s, a decade in which commitments to mass politics were reversed in favor of protective specialization around art and its autonomy. As other scholars have observed, the prioritization of transcendent aesthetic value over the historical position of the artist as producer is a hallmark of a liberal defense of modern arts—an alleged bulwark against philistinism and political prejudice.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> The surprise here is the place where Jarema made his declarations. He wrote his essay in Iraq for publication in <em>Kurier Polski w Bagdadzie</em> (Polish courier in Baghdad), a Polish-language newspaper established in December 1942. The occasion was an <em>Exhibition of Paintings by Polish Soldiers-Artists</em>, a major propaganda initiative of two hundred works of art, due to open soon at the British Institute in Baghdad.</p>\n<p>Upon arriving in Iraq in late 1942, a number of artists and writers attached to the Polish Army in the East for the Polish government in exile in London (later renamed the Polish II Corps), some of whom spent time as prisoners in secret camps in the USSR, undertook intensive propaganda efforts to generate support for Polish sovereignty. The creation of a newspaper to serve a population of displaced Polish persons was one initiative, but outreach to Iraqis was another. The artists in the group who enjoyed prewar recognition as modern painters set out to establish contact with their Iraqi counterparts, visiting cafés, holding lectures, and organizing exhibitions. Because at least two other Polish soldier-artists in Baghdad possessed Parisian credentials similar to Jarema’s, their discussion of art tended to accord a universal authority to their colorist approach to painting. As far as Jarema was concerned, the relative consistency of their style—sometimes described as pointillist or Divisionist and other times as postimpressionist—offered reason for optimism regarding Allied willingness to adopt the cause of a free Polish Republic as a plank in its liberal platform. As Jarema took care to report in his article, the Polish artists found common ground with the Iraqi artists who possessed at least some French training, and who thrilled to the “game of colorful contrasts” as well.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> The ease of the transfer struck Jarema as proof that displaced Polish artists would serve as stewards of a free and true cultural spirit and, moreover, do so at a time that artists in occupied Paris could not.</p>\n<p>Almost all accounts of the trajectory of modern art in Iraq reference the Polish influence on Iraqi artists during the war years. Iraqi artists attested to the significance of the encounter before the end of the war itself. By September 1943, Jewad Selim, a brilliant artist who went on to become one of Iraq’s most studied modernists, described to a friend how the Polish artists had “revived our relationship to Paris” and sparked new appreciation for the meaning and use of color.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> And Jamil Hamoudi, a student of Selim’s at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, wrote a short account of the “new generation” of artists in the country that credits the Poles with modeling how to “live for art alone.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> Soon, reviews of exhibitions mounted by Iraqi artists began to note the prevalence of work in a postimpressionist mode.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> In July 1945, Selim gave an interview in Baghdad that cited his interactions with the Polish artists as the most important event of his artistic life to date, in part because their postimpressionist training inclined them to appreciate the arts of the East as a source of compositional theory, which sparked Selim’s own interest in historical Iraqi arts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Most subsequent analyses have followed the template established by the initial testimonies by giving credit to foreign visitors for directing attention to painterly techniques—that is, the “how” of painting in addition to the “what”—and defining the problem of how Iraqi heritage might inform modern art.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>Historians of twentieth-century art will be just as familiar with claims to membership in charmed artist communities as we are with stories about transcendent aesthetic values; the narrative of a utopian “open city” welcoming all comers who prioritize art above other concerns is a mainstay of School of Paris propaganda during and after the war.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> To find it in the writing of Polish and Iraqi artists is to confront the success of the effort to equate an individual version of artistic autonomy with a collective ideal of a free and flourishing society, which would bolster a version of a liberal art world to come. Yet, it should not be forgotten that the British military chose to reoccupy Iraq in this period and, indeed, forcefully align its peoples with the strategic interests of the Allies. In the summer of 1941, nearly the whole of the military front sometimes dubbed the Near East—a tactical corridor connecting Cairo to Baghdad via Beirut and Damascus and onward to South Asia—experienced reoccupation by British militaries or Free French ones (the latter with British help), thereby shoring up oil, air fields, and provisions for ships against the Germans.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> Following these operations in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon, new wartime movements of people and supplies in the region spurred an unusual confluence of displaced artists in Baghdad who, for a variety of reasons, advocated fervently for the threatened values of freedom and experimentalism. Little attention has been paid to the motivations for Polish and Iraqi declarations of artistic friendship in this context, or to their appeal to membership in a wartime diaspora of Paris-aligned artists. Which is to say, when it comes to the history of artists and critics who consolidated discourses of art for art’s sake around the heroic ideals of progressive Modernism, what has still to be told is how these discourses connect intimately to late-colonial interests in war.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is not my aim in this article to dispute the evidence of Iraqi artists’ high regard for the universal values they perceived in the Polish artists’ paintings, which is abundant. My interests relate to historical and ideological queries: how a late-colonial community of soldiers, refugees, mobile intellectuals, and local artists came to model a version of modern art construed as free inquiry into form, or “art alone,” and how it operated in a space of uncertainty regarding the fate of a shared artistic enterprise in a world where centers had not held. As I hope to demonstrate, Allied propaganda in support of the necessity of war played a decisive role in structuring affinities between artists in a shared space that was neither officially a war zone nor a home front. In my research for this article, I explored the papers of Belgian poet and art dealer E. L. T. Mesens in the collection of the Getty Research Institute, which contains myriad letters to and from surrealist collaborators in exile and military service in cities in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East under Allied control. Equally, I worked with more dispersed and fragmentary archives pertaining to Iraqi artists Selim and Hamoudi and Polish painters Jarema and Józef Czapski. What follows, then, is a plot for future research on the re-signification of modern painting that took place amid the colonial entanglements at the crux of the war enterprise.</p>\n<h2>1. E. L. T. Mesens and War Propaganda</h2>\n<p>First, it is important to consider what can be learned from the activities of Mesens—a representative figure because of his self-appointed role as an arbiter of important European trends—in this period. In 1938, Mesens moved to London from Belgium to take up a position directing the London Gallery and promoting a self-consciously modern program of surrealist art and literature in particular. Mesens had no trouble recognizing the growing connection between surrealist thought and anti-fascist resistance movements. He and his collaborators used the gallery’s publication, <em>London Bulletin,</em> to publish the text of a manifesto from 1938 by principal French surrealist poet André Breton, Mexican painter Diego Rivera, and exiled communist theorist Leon Trotsky outlining a commitment to independent art as a political project meant to hasten a revolution, adding a note promising a manifesto by the British section of the project in a future issue.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> However, by late 1939, following money troubles and the destruction of at least a portion of the gallery’s collections in air raids, he halted most activities.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> There is little indication that Mesens took any subsequent steps to spur his small and disorganized group of English surrealists to action as a collective.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>Whereas Mesens exhibited minimal interest in direct organizing, he did answer calls to duty in the realm of British propagandizing. Beginning in 1943, he contributed to the BBC’s content for <em>Radio Belgique</em> broadcasts into German-occupied Belgium. He also entertained at least one special commission to produce a musical piece for the British Foreign Office. The commission would have entailed writing French lyrics for a preset tune for use in fostering a sense of common cause between French and British servicemen, as was thought necessary for success in major upcoming battles.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> Mesens received a text of suggested themes on the topic of struggle between Allied freedom and Axis repression. Typewritten sentences convey a set of shareable causes—“Liberation is coming. Stand together and work together. Be prepared to strike when the signal is given—to strike against the Nazi oppressors”—and conclude by enumerating a triad of core freedoms that represent the Allied cause: “freedom of thought, freedom of speech, freedom of action” (<a href=\"#fig-4-1\">fig. 1</a>). Mesens met with a representative from the Political Intelligence Department, only to ultimately refuse the request on the grounds of its uninspired relationship to art as a tool for the cause. Declaring the language and music of the song to be stilted and academic in its approach to theme, Mesens attempted to goad the Foreign Office into realizing art’s capacity to elicit real emotion. The appropriate way to generate a sense of inspiration, Mesens asserts in his response, is to evoke a popular spirit of spontaneous exultation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-01.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 1. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Suggested themes for lyrics sent from F.

Throughout the war, Mesens endeavored to use the London Gallery imprimatur to produce and circulate anthologies of French literature by surrealist-affiliated authors. One letter, sent in July 1943 to literary critic Herbert Read, identifies a growing reading public of “French reading refugees” in England, desirous of access to new French-language work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup> Notably, Mesens’s list of preferred contributors reflects a network of activity sustained by French flight to colonial and semicolonial locations. There is Breton’s poem “Fata Morgana,” which he composed in Marseille while en route to the Caribbean and later the United States, as well as “new and very good things” coming from the Americas by Benjamin Peret and Andre Masson, from Aimé Césaire in Martinique, and from Georges Henein in Cairo.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup> By the time of Mesens’s literary plotting in 1943, Breton had already laid claim to Césaire’s poetry, introducing him in the first issue of the New York journal <em>VVV</em> (spring 1942) as a friend and a “magnetic and black” figure who, from his home in Martinique, had managed to break with old French mores so as to write “the poems we need.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> Tellingly, although Mesens identifies Césaire’s incandescent poem “High Noon” for inclusion in his volume, he is unconcerned with its political specificity as a response to France’s wartime colonial domination over Martinique. Instead, Mesens directs attention to establishing a shared field of innovatory work, the existence of which is to be offered as a promise of transcendent talent in spite of suffocating war conditions.</p>\n<h2>2. Techniques of British Occupation in Iraq</h2>\n<p>In Iraq, Allied propaganda operated in a complementary yet distinct fashion. Over the preceding period of nominal independence from 1932 to 1941, Iraqi officials had expanded education in the name of cultivating a culture of enlightened Arabic thought based upon national commitment. Britain’s guiding strategy as the colonial authority came to emphasize a relationship of influence rather than direct control, which depended upon British affiliates serving as advisers to native government officials (all subtended, as historian Sara Pursley has argued, through what remained a very direct use of corporeal violence in other realms—from hanging and corvée labor to collective punishments in the form of air bombardment).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> The contradictory effects of the parallel development strategy manifested at such institutions as the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, established in 1926 around the archaeological collection of Gertrude Bell. Run as a condominium model that placed British experts among Iraqi national employees, the museum supported a network of spies—among them Bell herself and later antiquities adviser Seton Lloyd—at the same time that it presented increased opportunities to Iraqi artists. In 1934, the Iraq Museum gained an art studio at the initiative of newly appointed director of antiquities, Satiʿ al-Husri. Having already established a fellowship program to support artist training in Europe in his previous role as minister of education, al-Husri tasked the studio’s artists with enlivening archaeological finds by creating mural-scaled tableaux of historical events.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup></p>\n<p>In April 1941, Rashid al-Kaylani, a former prime minister who had attempted to use the office to free Iraq from colonial influence, led a coup that rejected Prime Minister Nuri al-Said’s policy of compliance with British demands for wartime censorship, curfews, and rationing, and challenged the legitimacy of the Hashemite monarchy. The British military responded by waging quick yet merciless war on the Iraqi military using both colonial battalions from India and aerial bombing. As the national government collapsed, perceptions of social unity disintegrated. Riots broke out targeting Iraqi Jews as external to national interests, and makeshift alliances of nationalist military, police, and urban subjects went door to door in poorer Jewish neighborhoods in Baghdad attacking persons and seizing property.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> These events, known in the Iraqi Jewish community as the <em>farhud</em> (meaning dispossession), revealed how violent and exclusionary strands of nationalism had dovetailed with a cause of ostensible liberation.</p>\n<p>The crisis ended only with the entrance of British troops into the city. British authorities restored Crown Prince Abd al-Ilah (the uncle of the toddler King Faisal II) to the role of Regent and rededicated efforts to prop up the offices of the monarchy as an authority. Rather than attempt an expensive full military occupation, colonial strategists again turned to systems of influence, albeit now with ever wider outreach.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup> By 1944, no fewer than one hundred people were working in the publicity department of the British embassy in Iraq. High-ranking employees hosted parties and cinema nights for educated Iraqis whom they hoped to cultivate as friends.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup> The same network brought Edward Bawden, an English artist with an official war commission, into contact with Iraqi artists, even as he declined to engage with their work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> Bawden’s sketches from Iraq offer a pictorial record of attempts in the era to establish a social meaning for the Hashemite monarchy. One of his most striking watercolors features a trademark British initiative: a cinema boat that plied the Euphrates taking films to rural populations, complete with bunting and ceremonial gun salute. Bawden makes sure to depict on the outdoor screen an image from its standard cinematic fare: the Regent Abd al-llah, the “star” of British propaganda, appears as if in a newsreel, wearing a British uniform, engaging in conversation and holding a porcelain teacup (<a href=\"#fig-4-2\">fig. 2</a>).</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-02.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-2\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 2. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Edward Bawden (British, 1903–89).</strong> <em>The Showboat at Baghdad</em>, 1944, watercolor on paper, 66 × 100.5 cm.

For instance, English artist Kenneth Wood, whose military service included employment in Baghdad from 1943 to 1946, was assigned to improve color printing capacities in the city and set up a lithography studio that offered training to a first generation of Iraqi graphic designers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup> Wood impressed his Iraqi friends with his technical acumen in studio art as well as in applied work. Over time, he developed a distinctive semisurrealist method of watercolor composition to capture the city’s phantasmagoric night life, and would cap his time in Baghdad by writing up his philosophies and methods for Hamoudi to publish in Arabic.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> The same period saw Lloyd move into action to secure art supplies for the Iraqi artists he favored.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup></p>\n<h2>3. Jewad Selim’s Return to Baghdad</h2>\n<p>This late-colonial matrix provided an important armature for Jewad Selim’s career as representative of a new generation in Iraq. Born to a painter father with training from an Ottoman military academy, Selim and his siblings—brothers Suad and Nizar, and sister Naziha—all pursued creative professions, and did so across multiple fields, including painting and sculpture, caricature, music, and stage productions. In 1938, Selim received a fellowship to study in Paris. Arriving in Europe at the age of nineteen, he sought to acquire training as a sculptor and managed to gain admittance to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, only to be forced home by declarations of war in 1939. The following summer, Selim attempted to restart his studies in Rome, only to return once again to Iraq.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup> Resigned by 1941 to waiting out the hostilities from Baghdad, Selim took positions as an instructor of sculpture at the Institute of Fine Arts and as an artist in the painting workshop of the Iraq Museum.</p>\n<p>Selim’s initial artistic activities upon his second return reflect a sense of unease, which he appears to explore by plumbing the crisis tropes established by earlier European artists. Inaugurating a sketchbook bearing the title, in Italian, “Contemplations of my Spirit,” he filled its pages with quotations and drawings that give an impression of Romantic malcontent.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup> Early text entries include a stanza of poetry by Paul Verlaine expressing the melancholia sparked by an absent lover, which Selim copied in French: “Oh, sad, sad was my soul because, because—for a woman’s sake it was.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup> Selim’s drawings, meanwhile, riff on a corpus of nineteenth-century imagery. In one, he echoes the slumping physicality of a sketch by French sculptor Auguste Rodin intended to illustrate Charles Baudelaire’s volume of poetry <em>Fleurs du Mal</em> (<a href=\"#fig-4-3\">fig. 3</a>). Rodin’s drawing associates bodily humility with problems of sin and transference. Selim’s drawing assigns the pose to a new ambivalent figure, likely captioned (in French) “the creative man,” who experiences disappointment in the very world he has created (<a href=\"#fig-4-4\">fig. 4</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-03.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-3\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 3. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Auguste Rodin (French, 1840–1917).</strong> Illustration in Charles Baudelaire, <em>Vingt-sept poèmes des Fleurs du Mal</em> (Paris: La Société des Amis du Livre Moderne, 1918).

Jabra identifies an increasing recognition of the war itself as the source of affliction, including in its extractive economic dimensions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup> Selim’s oeuvre features several paintings depicting sex workers waiting for clients in the streets of Baghdad, created with a bright palette of brushy marks, as well as drawings of scenes of lust and debauchery sourced from an array of literary sources, both Arabic and foreign (<a href=\"#fig-4-5\">fig. 5</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fnref37\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">37</a></sup> These images can all be read in a context of the British occupation of Iraq wherein barracks outside the city held thousands of soldiers, outbreaks of malaria were frequent, and trainees came to the city to patronize bars and brothels.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fnref38\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">38</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-05.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-5\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 5. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Jewad Selim (Iraqi, 1919–61).</strong> <em>Nisāʾ fī al-Intiẓār</em> (Women waiting), 1943, oil on board, 45 × 35 cm.

When the <em>Exhibition of Paintings by Polish Soldiers-Artists</em> opened in 1943 under the sponsorship of ministers, commanders, and advisers, the officialism of the proceedings gained some relief from the presence of invited Iraqi artists, who greeted the Polish artists as peers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fnref39\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">39</a></sup> Selim offered remarks in Arabic on behalf of the group, and is reported to have expressed excitement about hosting an exhibition of European art in Baghdad for the first time as well as support for Polish goals.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fnref40\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">40</a></sup> Soon thereafter, Selim and colleague Faiq Hassan received invitations to exhibit work in Alexandria and Cairo as part of an initiative by the Friends of Art society in Egypt, an organization that enjoyed the patronage of the Egyptian monarchy.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fnref41\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">41</a></sup> The plan to feature Iraqi painters among the expanding community of Allied artists must have promised to add legitimacy to propaganda claims about common cause.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fnref42\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">42</a></sup> At home, meanwhile, Selim frequented the parties thrown by the head Public Relations Officer of the British Embassy and sold him paintings at an exhibition of the Iraqi Artists Association.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fnref43\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">43</a></sup> By 1944, a pivotal year when British acts of friendship in Iraq became oriented toward postwar alliances, Selim not only began to work with Lloyd to cultivate opportunities for solo exhibitions but also accepted invitations to deliver lectures on art to British soldiers.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fnref44\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">44</a></sup></p>\n<h2>4. Polish Artists Take Refuge in Iraq</h2>\n<p>The Polish painters entered this cultural space beginning in the autumn of 1942 and stayed through most of 1943. They brought with them recollections of interwar Paris and a defining interest in light and color. As Selim later observed, their memory of the French capital differed in spirit from the weary nerves and dark painting he witnessed during his stay at the time of the Second World War.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fnref45\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">45</a></sup> Not only had Józef Czapski, Józef Jarema, and Edward Matuszczak sought entry to postimpressionist circles but they had also been prepared for their mission by a beloved teacher, Józef Pankiewicz, who had preceded them in Paris and embraced Divisionist color strategies.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fnref46\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">46</a></sup> Their group held French painter Pierre Bonnard in particularly high esteem for his ability to amplify color and composition at once and sought entry to his circles. Upon returning to Warsaw, they developed a reputation as “Kapists”—the Polish acronym for the “Paris Committee” they had formed to support their studies—who located the mission of painting in the search for compositional realities that are independent of denotative subject matter.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fnref47\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">47</a></sup> They were not abstractionists, but they took the academic genres of still life, portrait, and landscape as pretexts to pursue the artistic end of building form in color. So committed were Jarema and Matuszczak to keeping focus on daubs of color that their Baghdad landscape paintings bore little immediate resemblance to the relatively clear light conditions on the banks of the Tigris (<a href=\"#fig-4-6\">fig. 6</a>).</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-06--FPO.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-6\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 6. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Edward Matuszczak (Polish, 1906–65).</strong> Landscape from Baghdad, 1943, oil on canvas, 44.5 × 51.5 cm.

Alexandria, Egypt, Museum of Fine Arts.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>The Kapist presence in Baghdad, nearly twenty years after their stint in Paris, was a complicated consequence of Nazi Germany’s attack on the USSR in August 1941.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fnref48\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">48</a></sup> The earlier German invasion of Poland in September 1939 divided the country between the Third Reich and the USSR on terms secretly negotiated between those powers, precipitating deportations of hundreds of thousands of Poles to the Soviet interior and filling undisclosed camps with prisoners of war (among them Czapski). Once Germany reversed agreements in 1941 and Stalin faced an urgent need to grow military power, the USSR entered the fold of the Grand Alliance. An agreement with the Polish government-in-exile, signed in London, restored diplomatic ties and provided for the release of prisoners. Over a series of months, a Polish fighting force was assembled and moved through central Asia. In April 1942, however, commander Wladyslaw Anders decided to move these groups out of the USSR and away from its whims, evacuating more than 100,000 people by crossing through British-controlled Iran. A large contingent of volunteer fighters headed to Iraq to prepare to rejoin the war, including Polish soldiers already affiliated with other units in the region (among them, Jarema), forming a Polish Army in the East that would train in coordination with the British military.</p>\n<p>In exile, the Polish government pursued a survival strategy based on deepening connections to an Allied vision of common victory. Jarema may have been one of the first to promote his ties to Parisian prestige as an asset—he formulated a strategy to this effect in 1941 while still stationed in Egypt, prior to the release of Polish prisoners in the USSR or the reunion of Kapists in Baghdad.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn49\" id=\"fnref49\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">49</a></sup> At least one interview from Egypt introduces him as a postimpressionist and describes his exhibition as a “show of faith” in the continuation of great traditions of painting.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn50\" id=\"fnref50\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">50</a></sup> As Jarema explained to local journalists, to exhibit painting of this kind was to signal resistance against the new barbarism of the day. Crucially, by equating a “great tradition” with a style of composition recognizable in daubs of color, Jarema established a marker for tracking both Polish artistic accomplishments and the imprint of their values on other artists.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn51\" id=\"fnref51\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">51</a></sup> Once in Baghdad, he espoused the views of an “extreme impressionist,” advocating for an exclusive focus on the application of color to a surface and eliminating the use of black paint.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn52\" id=\"fnref52\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">52</a></sup> So committed was he to elevating his version of serious painting that he drew skeptical commentary from other Poles. One article, which imputes a combative character to the Polish opposition to academicism, describes the exhibited work as “a little closed off to those indifferent to it” and at odds with common taste.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn53\" id=\"fnref53\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">53</a></sup></p>\n<p>Czapski, who was appointed to head the Public Relations and Information Department for Anders, made a more affective personal case for recuperating a spirit of Parisian freedom. As other scholars detail, Czapski had survived two years in Soviet prisons in part by taking up intellectual work—namely, plumbing his memory of French literature to deliver brilliant lectures on Marcel Proust to fellow prisoners—as a buttress against despair.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn54\" id=\"fnref54\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">54</a></sup> Upon his release, he readily credited “French art” with “help[ing] us live through those few years in the USSR” and continued to lecture on French culture as part of diplomatic tours to Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn55\" id=\"fnref55\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">55</a></sup> Once in Baghdad, Czapski joined his Polish colleagues in calling on the Iraqi artists to deliver a message of cultivation and possibility. French was the lingua franca for these encounters. From his diary entries, it is possible to detect a private despair over his grim responsibilities and a hint of contempt toward interlocutors with whom he was unable to communicate in any depth due to their possession of only elementary French-language skills.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn56\" id=\"fnref56\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">56</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Iraqi painters, for their part, rose to the invitation to mutuality with grace; at one gathering, artist Atta Sabri spoke about being “brothers in art.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn57\" id=\"fnref57\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">57</a></sup> They shared their studios with the Polish visitors, doing their best to create conditions for the displaced painters to continue advancing their work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn58\" id=\"fnref58\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">58</a></sup> Such actions accorded with the statements of support that their British-backed prime minister, Nuri al-Said, had extended to Polish refugees in January following his declaration of war on Germany, which credited Iraqi traditions of hospitality as impetus for the welcome.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn59\" id=\"fnref59\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">59</a></sup> Once the <em>Exhibition of Paintings by Polish Soldiers-Artists</em> opened on 15 February 1943, in turn, it offered a venue for further expression of familial feeling. Artist Matuszczak exhibited a portrait painting he had made of the mother of Iraqi artist Hassan.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn60\" id=\"fnref60\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">60</a></sup> And, not only did the Iraqi state and municipality purchase Polish art but Selim also saw fit to make a personal purchase of a painting from Jarema as another expression of brotherhood.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn61\" id=\"fnref61\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">61</a></sup></p>\n<p>From the Polish side of the cause, both Jarema and Czapski issued critical interpretations of the stakes of the exhibition, which was set to tour other cities under British influence to which soldiers and refugees had gone: Cairo, Alexandria, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem. Each artist addressed the fact of displaced inspiration, from the former Parisian center to elsewhere, as a defining uncertainty of the age. In this regard, discussion of the fate of Western culture jibes with that of American critics who sensed opportunity to claim guardianship of it. As Serge Guilbaut reports in his classic study <em>How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art</em> of 1983, critic Harold Rosenberg responded to the occupation of Paris by opining in the <em>Partisan Review</em>’s December 1940 issue, “No one can predict which city or nation will be the center of this new phase,” emphasizing the need to recover and protect the world-historical importance of Paris against mere national interests.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn62\" id=\"fnref62\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">62</a></sup> Jarema, for his part, used his promotional article in <em>Kurier Polski w Bagdadzie</em> of February 1943 to outline the possibility of new communities of authority to be forged laterally between artists at different points in the world. By way of illustration, he boasts that the Polish soldier-artists exerted an “agitating” force on Baghdad’s stagnant academic scene. For Jarema, the Paris connection—strengthened by its loss—provided the basis for interpersonal affinities in their newly deterritorialized art world. He claims that painters across the world belong to the “Paris team,” defined as the generation of artists who studied art in Paris over the years 1920–39. They exist as if a large family scattered all over the world, ready to be activated in sudden and intimate fashion thanks to shared concepts, culture, and terminology.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn63\" id=\"fnref63\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">63</a></sup></p>\n<p>Czapski’s commentary comes in the form of a lecture he delivered in English for the opening, later printed in Polish in <em>Kurier Polski w Bagdadzie.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn64\" id=\"fnref64\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">64</a></sup> It too takes stock of the reordered cultural authority of the time, but proceeds by reference to historical arts as models of emotional power equivalent to modernist composition. Specifically, Czapski praises the Sumerian art in the Iraq Museum for its formal achievement, proceeding to describe the development of art as a pendulum swinging between realism and abstraction, always inspired to change by new encounters with other traditions. The lecture makes a point that Jarema seems to avoid for the most part, which is that reproductive technologies such as photography allow artists to access a full cache of world arts. Unlike Jarema, Czapski had been practicing his own version of a worldly response to multiple arts while stationed in the region; diary entries reveal that he sketched in museums and sites in Damascus, Jerusalem, Cairo, and elsewhere, some of whose artworks he had first admired in exhibition catalogs accessed in Paris (<a href=\"#fig-4-7\">fig. 7</a>). His textual notes detail strong in-person responses to certain historical works, such as the synagogue murals from Dura Europos in the National Museum of Damascus (in fact, Czapski records that he sees in the murals a riposte to Jarema’s color theories).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn65\" id=\"fnref65\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">65</a></sup> Czapski’s contributions to the major Polish exhibitions in Iraq also diverged from the Kapist ideals in terms of medium. Although he had attempted to work with the oil paints Jarema brought him as a means to revive the progression of Polish painterly modernism, Czapski found paints difficult to maintain in practice, and instead exhibited relatively pale ink-and-wash sketches of quotidian scenes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn66\" id=\"fnref66\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">66</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-07.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 7. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Józef Czapski (Polish, 1896–1993).</strong> Drawing in diary, 21 January 1943.

Image: Laboratory Stock National Museum in Krakow.</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Ultimately, Czapski’s lecture posited a different version of the loss of a Parisian center. Raising, as others had, the question of constituting a new capital for artists, he asserted, “None of us can prophesize where on the globe the next great painting will arise. Paris was the center of the world for artists recently, as was Rome in the 16th century. Will Paris, after its last tragedy, after the fall of France, continue to be the capital of artists after the war?”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn67\" id=\"fnref67\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">67</a></sup> But, whereas Rosenberg indicted fellow intellectuals for their collective failure to protect Paris from the taint of political obligations, Czapski appeals to fellow artists to maintain a generous relationship to the world and its potential to form capital centers. Indeed, he proposes that the best versions of national art will fluoresce in conditions of coexistence. More than many others on the side of the Allies, Czapski seems inclined to refuse a “return” to consolidated authority of any kind—national or ostensibly international. To make his point about Polish and other national painting traditions necessarily drawing on a world inheritance of arts, he employs a Christian vocabulary of illumination to describe the expression of art within the people and materials of different places and times: “The spirit breathes where it wants.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn68\" id=\"fnref68\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">68</a></sup></p>\n<h2>5. Studying a World History for Modern Art</h2>\n<p>A key issue remains to be clarified. Apart from statements asserting that an exchange of style took place, what evidence do we have of Polish influence on Iraqi artists? Surviving physical works from this period are, admittedly, few. Although a guide from 1943 to a newly created Iraqi national collection reveals the presence of more than a dozen recently acquired works by Polish and other European artists, these appear to be lost to either neglect or, as in the aftermath of the catastrophic American invasion of Iraq in 2003, active looting. Also unknown are the whereabouts of the Iraqi paintings, of which nearly fifty—oil paintings, watercolors, caricatures, and drawings in pencil and charcoal—are listed in the same guide. Loss has been ongoing. In 2010, Selim’s sketchbook, which featured drawings and sayings he copied from Bonnard, among other likely direct responses to Polish outreach, was destroyed when a car bomb hit the Jabra family home.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, two issues of a handwritten magazine produced by Hamoudi between 1942 and 1944 have survived that offer insight into artists’ changing treatments of color, postimpressionist composition, and stylistic politics. Such magazines were a common avocation of Arab students who saw themselves as tastemakers in the tradition of anthologies, translations, and critical commentary.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn69\" id=\"fnref69\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">69</a></sup> Hamoudi’s magazine took the title <em>ʻAshtarūt</em>, one of many possible names for goddesses of regeneration and rebirth in ancient Mesopotamian civilizations, and oriented its contents toward a readership of other artists and art students. Its pages feature commentary on art trends, essays on cultural phenomena (both translated and original), reviews of local exhibitions, and “gallery” sections of sample works (some originals, some clipped from publications, and others copied by hand from a source).</p>\n<p>Certain items in <em>ʻAshtarūt</em> reveal that Allied narratives of threats to artistic freedom had saturated the Iraqi scene by routes other than the Polish artists. For instance, in February 1944, Hamoudi opted to translate part of an article from the British magazine <em>Lilliput</em> titled “Where Are the Surrealists Now?,” detailing the sorry fates of surrealists in occupied Paris by naming artists who went underground or, worse, began collaborating with the Vichy government.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn70\" id=\"fnref70\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">70</a></sup> <em>Lilliput,</em> which billed itself on its cover as “the pocket magazine for everyone,” specialized in irreverent content aimed at preserving British resolve to resist authoritarianism. It could have come to Iraq in any number of ways, via a newsstand catering to the British military or on the person of an individual visitor. In its appearance in <em>ʻAshtarūt</em> as a translated excerpt, the article provided Iraqi readers with an introduction to the surrealist movement overall as well as a briefing on imperiled artistic freedom as a wartime cause célèbre. Hamoudi makes the decision to illustrate the piece with a surrealist drawing from 1933 by Pablo Picasso that he copied from a different magazine (<a href=\"#fig-4-8\">fig. 8</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn71\" id=\"fnref71\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">71</a></sup> The drawing replaces the photographic portraits of eccentric artists in their studios that accompany the original article, thereby directing attention to the question of what surrealism is and how to recognize it, in addition to the question of where one is free to practice it.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-08.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-8\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 8. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Jamil Hamoudi (Iraqi, 1924–2003).</strong> Pen drawing in <em>ʿAshtarūt,</em> no. 4 (February 1944): n.p., captioned: “Image: Zephyr, by the great artist Picasso.” Beirut, Nami Jafet Memorial Library, American University of Beirut, Archives and Special Collections, Jamil Hamoudi Collection, 1917–2012, box 36.

Keyed to an excerpted essay by Egyptian-Lebanese intellectual Bishr Fares, an experimental poet and playwright who had been advocating for Symbolist modernist aesthetics since the 1930s, a quotation on the cover highlights Fares’s metaphysical reading of color in an intermedial field of arts: “Nature is a color that addresses us through its light vibrations, an intermittent and volatile address”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn73\" id=\"fnref73\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">73</a></sup> (<a href=\"#fig-4-9\">fig. 9</a>). This insight is attributed, on the cover and in the essay itself, to “the Impressionists,” referring to the European painting movement, yet Fares grants kindred insights to dancers and others who work with mobile forms of perception. In turn, Hamoudi’s cover design features color patches—dashes of watercolor tone—swirling within an ornate frame. The resulting depiction of color impressions is tied to theories of matter and imagination more than any one painterly lineage. Further, it reflects a robust space of cultural commentary in the broader Arab press, where scholars had long commented on modern art movements.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-09.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-9\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 9. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Cover of <em>ʿAshtarūt</em>, no. 4 (February 1944).</strong> Beirut, Nami Jafet Memorial Library, American University of Beirut, Archives and Special Collections, Jamil Hamoudi Collection, 1917–2012, box 36.

Anthropologist Saleem Al-Bahloly emphasizes the discursive quality of Polish artistic practice as an influence, suggesting that it allowed Iraqi artists to position their own painting in a space of active cultural renewal.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn74\" id=\"fnref74\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">74</a></sup> A similar view emerges in Selim’s own testimonies from the time, which express admiration for how Polish artists framed the artistic task as an intellectual endeavor. A letter he wrote to a friend in September 1943 containing his first of two epistolary assessments of the Polish artists’ influence echoes many of the by-then official talking points about affinity, including excitement about their mutual Parisian referent.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn75\" id=\"fnref75\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">75</a></sup> But it also credits the heightening of his attunement to color as a compositional element to their late-night debates in the city’s cafes. In order to provide his friend with an example of instructive past achievements, Selim highlights al-Wasiti’s nonnaturalistic use of color to illustrate a flock of camels as achieving a rhythmic pattern of its own. The example allows Selim to clarify that he derives motivation from Czapski’s enthusiasm for the arts of the region. In Selim’s retelling, their Polish interlocutor had revealed how French painters had enriched their practice by reference to arts of the East, studying images “from the Land of the Rising Sun to Africa.” Czapski challenged the Iraqi artists to treat the historical arts of their own region as an “inexhaustible” resource for the present.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn76\" id=\"fnref76\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">76</a></sup></p>\n<p>Whereas Czapski’s spellbinding discussions of art history undoubtedly mediated Selim’s engagement with al-Wasiti, it is important to recognize that the Iraqi artists responded to the Polish message of enfolded traditions by undertaking cross-cultural studies of form that range beyond art with Baghdadi origins. On this count, <em>ʿAshtarūt</em> again provides evidence of the relatively capacious approach of the time. An issue compiled in late 1943 includes a special section on Islamic art accompanied by an image program meant to augment readers’ familiarity with its genres and achievements. There are two texts. One is a treatment of Islamic art excerpted from a volume on medieval art by popular French author Elie Faure, heavily edited and translated into Arabic by Selim.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn77\" id=\"fnref77\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">77</a></sup> The second is a short original essay by Hamoudi discussing the range of artistic genres found at Islamic sites and a tentative assessment of possibilities for sculpture (his chosen métier) within the tradition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn78\" id=\"fnref78\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">78</a></sup> The image program, as was common for <em>ʿAshtarūt,</em> consists of drawings copied by hand from textbook illustrations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn79\" id=\"fnref79\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">79</a></sup> Remarkably, given the contemporaneous discussions of color, these image specimens are rendered in black outline and are devoid of tinted wash: wall painting from Fatimid Cairo, tracery ornament from an Abbasid palace in Baghdad, a drawing of a decorated pottery shard positioned on the page as if it had been clipped from an archaeology report, and a portrait of a “Persian” prince (erroneously attributed to Bihzad)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn80\" id=\"fnref80\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">80</a></sup> (<a href=\"#fig-4-10\">figs. 10</a>, <a href=\"#fig-4-11\">11</a>).

Indeed, the image of the seated “Persian” prince, a figurative image rendered in elegant outline, has been pulled from a different section of Faure’s book and belongs to a separate argument about Persian aesthetics. These transpositions, in which images were plucked from historical narratives for insertion into albums, suggest that Iraqi artists pursued a parallel project of study meant to bring Islamic image examples into a shared fine art frame in Baghdad, with its portraits, landscapes, and still lives. Contributors to <em>ʿAshtarūt</em> documented forms as outlines in ways that enhanced utility for new composition. Their attempt could even extend to enlarging and projecting historical examples, as Selim describes having done in the case of al-Wasiti.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn82\" id=\"fnref82\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">82</a></sup> The insights they sought were neither limited to color nor beholden to European modalities of appropriation. Rather, they engaged with the immanence of form and its availability to artists in the present.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn83\" id=\"fnref83\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">83</a></sup></p>\n<h2>6. Baghdad, an Open City</h2>\n<p>Selim wrote a second epistolary characterization of the Polish encounter in November 1944, his most frequently cited.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn84\" id=\"fnref84\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">84</a></sup> By then, the Polish II Corps had left Baghdad for action in Italy, and the French 2nd Armored Division and the U.S. 4th Infantry Division had liberated Paris. In fact, Jarema carried ideas about community between artists to Rome, where he founded an international art club for the purpose of promoting revived universalism in peacetime.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn85\" id=\"fnref85\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">85</a></sup> Over the same period, Selim began to place new emphases on the meaning of the community of displaced artists in Baghdad. Struck by reports that Picasso had been recovered from hiding in Paris, upon which the Spanish artist made proud claims that he had not stopped working during his four years out of the public eye, Selim comments on how Picasso receded from vision at precisely the time Iraqi artists struggled into recognition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn86\" id=\"fnref86\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">86</a></sup> “During those four years, when Paris and Europe ceased to make beautiful work, Baghdad kept on working,” he observes. Even though Baghdad had few resources with which to support modern work, its artists kept on working to surmount the difficulties, build institutions, and revive the materials of their traditions.</p>\n<p>Selim’s phrasing chimes with many of the propaganda narratives I have been tracking insofar as he names a city, Baghdad, as a protagonist and as a synecdoche of the fate of modern art. More typically, of course, that protagonist is Paris. Writing on a date when study in Europe again seemed possible, Selim characterizes the preceding years as a mission of world historical importance. Artists had come to Baghdad as a city that remained open to foreigners and there helped to preserve modern art on behalf of occupied Europe. He mentions this key displacement twice, stating about ambitious artists, “If Europe had put a stop to their production, then Baghdad welcomed their work.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn87\" id=\"fnref87\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">87</a></sup> What the openness of Baghdad enabled was recognition of a bond between artists who had continued to labor in the name of art alone, “bound by sincere humanity and love of life and efforts in the path of natural order—love of life and the simple things that could make us forget death.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn88\" id=\"fnref88\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">88</a></sup> Crucially, Selim borrows his heightened language of forgetting death from Faure, his favorite art historian.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn89\" id=\"fnref89\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">89</a></sup> The sentence in question, the final line of Faure’s fourth volume of <em>Histoire de l’art</em>, defines art as a creative act that justifies itself simply in its joyful performance.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn90\" id=\"fnref90\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">90</a></sup> Faure likens art to the activity of play, which sociology had shown to be restorative precisely because it has no obvious use and thus differs from the otherwise alienated labor of modern life. Selim, writing in 1944, transferred the insight to the artistic activity on offer in Baghdad during the war years. As a practice of pure art for the sake of art, it provided an experience of rehumanization on behalf of all humanity.</p>\n<h2>7. <em>Al-Fikr al-Ḥadīth</em> and Cultural Freedom</h2>\n<p>As the war appeared to come to a close, references to cultural freedom—conceived as independence from political influence—began to proliferate in the art worlds associated with the Allied forces. In Cairo, in May 1945, the group of artists and writers known as Art and Liberty presented the fifth exhibition of independent art they had staged since convening for the first time in 1940.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn91\" id=\"fnref91\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">91</a></sup> Their exhibition title, <em>Le séance continue</em> (The séance continues), named an imperative to continue organizing beyond the seeming restoration of peace, precisely because so many people remained in thrall to military might. The catalog is studded with references to kindred initiatives of independent art within the same network of free writers and artists that Mesens embraced from London: <em>Al-Tatawwur</em> (Evolution) in Cairo, <em>Tropiques</em> (Tropics) in Martinique, <em>VVV</em> in New York, <em>La Mandrágora</em> (The Mandrake) in Chile, and others.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn92\" id=\"fnref92\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">92</a></sup> Importantly, for my argument, despite lip service to art’s subversive possibilities, the Cairo exhibition still upheld the status of the British military and colonial administration as a cultural partner. For instance, its roster of exhibiting artists included Kenneth Wood, the English soldier turned public relations officer then working in Baghdad.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn93\" id=\"fnref93\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">93</a></sup></p>\n<p>In Iraq, in September 1945, Hamoudi finally succeeded in securing access to a printing press and launched a cultural journal he called <em>Al-Fikr al-Ḥadīth</em> (Modern Thought). Carrying the subtitle “a magazine of art and free culture,” it too invoked the anticipatory postwar category of cultural freedom.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn94\" id=\"fnref94\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">94</a></sup> The aspiration of the editors was to match the level of Egypt’s and Lebanon’s cultural magazines, and they followed a little-magazine model devoted to anthologizing material for readers without deference to group affiliation or special interest.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn95\" id=\"fnref95\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">95</a></sup> Hamoudi’s opening editorial characterizes the modern thinker as a reader who seeks enlightenment by freeing the individual self from all restraints, thinking beyond one’s own personal identity without any religious or social bigotry, and seeking knowledge without ulterior motive.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn96\" id=\"fnref96\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">96</a></sup></p>\n<p>It is at this point that Mesen’s correspondence picks up news of initiatives in the region. When Simon Watson Taylor, a poet and former secretary of the English surrealist group, found himself taking off to Cairo in late 1945 on a military contract with the Entertainments National Service Association, he sent word to Mesens about the journey. Watson Taylor met with Henein, picked up a copy of the catalog to <em>Le séance continue</em>, and revived contacts for future journal exchanges.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn97\" id=\"fnref97\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">97</a></sup> Next, once his troupe moved onward to Baghdad in early 1946, Watson Taylor managed to bear witness to formations of independent culture in Iraq. Scouting for audiences for his own surrealist publications in the works, he met the coeditors of <em>Al-Fikr al-Ḥadīth</em> and delivered news of avant-garde activities. Watson Taylor’s visit is documented in subsequent issues of the magazine in a variety of ways, including translations of some of his poetry and a three-part discussion of the surrealist movement.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn98\" id=\"fnref98\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">98</a></sup> Later, once Watson Taylor returned to London and sent copies of his own much-delayed journal, titled <em>Free Unions,</em> he briefed Hamoudi on surrealist initiatives underway in Romania and Belgium and promise the impending restoration of Paris as a center in a postwar art world (<a href=\"#fig-4-12-a-b\">figs. 12a, b</a>). This information, too, went into print in <em>Al-Fikr al-Ḥadīth.</em><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn99\" id=\"fnref99\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">99</a></sup></p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-4-12-a\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-12-a\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/lenssen-12-a.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4-12-a\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 12a</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>12a, b.

By then, he had begun to conceive of his magazine as a document of the vital contemporaneity of Baghdad during the preceding war years. Carrying issues of <em>Al-Fikr al-Ḥadīth</em> with him to Europe, he gave copies to the editors of the Belgian journal <em>Petit Cobra</em> (none of whom read Arabic), who dutifully published a notice attesting to a diversity of modern thought in Iraq.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn100\" id=\"fnref100\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">100</a></sup> As Hamoudi later recounted it, upon arriving in Paris, he initially sought affiliation with Breton’s group, only to grow disillusioned with its apparent nihilism and turn to Cobra and its tenets of spontaneity, before ultimately seeking entry to the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles (Salon of New Realities).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn101\" id=\"fnref101\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">101</a></sup> By then he believed that surrealism had reached its end as a movement and that postimpressionism would turn more abstract and concrete.</p>\n<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>\n<p>How might we understand the alliances forged in wartime Baghdad under the propitious eye of British empire? Some of the vocabulary I have highlighted in this article, such as “brotherhood” and “family,” may call to mind literary theorist Leela Gandhi’s reading of instances of elected affinity between European intellectuals and the victims of their own expansionist cultures.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn102\" id=\"fnref102\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">102</a></sup> Gandhi is interested in attending to nonplayers in a drama of imperialism as a possible internal critique of empire in the earlier twentieth century. Yet, as the details of artistic exchange in Iraq make apparent, the late-colonial conditions of the war years—the violence of policed national borders coexisting with an imperial imagination of endless dominion—bestowed an artificial, highly externalized quality on acts of friendship. As Polish newspapers published news about artists passing time together in cafés or studios, they rendered everyday exchanges into epics of European cultural survival. Allied propaganda in its many guises had the effect of converting elective affinities into displays of support for military campaigns.</p>\n<p>The discursive machinations of the 1940s were not secret. Artists on the Near Eastern front perceived elements of duplicity in the promises of freedom they helped to mobilize. As early as April 1946, Hamoudi offered the observation in <em>Al-Fikr al-Ḥadīth</em> that Iraqi artists derived much motivation from Polish art yet little from British art, proposing as a partial explanation that “we are not inclined to the English because we feel from them the attitude of a colonizer toward the colonized.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn103\" id=\"fnref103\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">103</a></sup> For Czapski, it was the Yalta Conference of 1945 ceding Poland to Soviet interests that terminated all lingering belief in the Allied propaganda. In a later publication, Czapski rued how Polish volunteer soldiers took inspiration from Romantic national poetry to convince themselves that universal war would deliver freedom for all, for all time. Their imagination accorded all too readily with the cynical slogans of the Allied press, then trumpeting a message about war “for the liberty of peoples.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn104\" id=\"fnref104\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">104</a></sup> But equally it rested upon willingness to ignore the truth of internal barbarity. Czapski shares that the British military had imposed press controls on his Polish Information Office, which prevented them from writing about Soviet atrocities.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn105\" id=\"fnref105\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">105</a></sup> The gag order was thought necessary to maintain the willingness of Allied soldiers to fight beside one another in a battle framed in moral terms.</p>\n<p>Across a vast archipelago of colonies and bases in the Near East, stories of art for art’s sake were narrated time and time again. Allied propaganda gave everyone a role to play in sustaining a tradition that was at once directly attributed to Europe as a bastion of artistic freedom yet construed as a matter of universal concern. What I find most instructive about how Polish and Iraqi artists kept on working in Baghdad is that they explored ways to claim the moral authority of an obviously fabricated conceit of Paris as an open city ruled by art alone. Yet, the myth could not hold. After all, as the colonial conditions of their exchanges make clear, there were no innocent positions then, and there are none now. The Allied countries that fought Nazism in Europe also conducted military campaigns with impunity in Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. As Nigerian curator and theorist Okwui Enwezor argued in a 2016 essay, drawing on the wartime analysis of Aimé Césaire, it is necessary to understand the terrible killing fields of the war, and the industrial-scale annihilation of the Holocaust, in the same frame as the colonial development of technologies of race, bureaucracy, and violence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn106\" id=\"fnref106\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">106</a></sup> In turn, if we can bear witness to how the late-colonial world orchestrated ideas of transcendent aesthetic value, then we might escape from the too-easy moral oppositions we inherit from its war propaganda. To speak, as some Modernist art critics have, of pure art emerging from preceding collectivist dreams in heroic fashion, is to invite continued violence against the impure, the out of place, and the unfree. By contrast, a history of global modernism that orients itself to humanity must be open to registering the intersubjective vulnerabilities that bind us within the commingled history of our brutal present.</p>\n<p class=\"grj-contributor-bio\"><strong>Anneka Lenssen</strong> is an associate professor of global modern art at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>\n<h2 class=\"notes-heading\">Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"backmatter\">This article originated as an attempt to think through a challenge Nada Shabout extended to art historians in 2009, which is to treat Iraqi artists who studied in European academies as participants in modern Western art. I drafted the article in 2017 during my postdoctoral fellowship at the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles and finished it in 2022 while in residence at New York University Abu Dhabi in the Humanities Research Fellowship for the Study of the Arab World program. Both proved to be fitting settings for assessing the entanglements of art and military interests in a so-called liberal age. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from the Polish, French, and the Arabic are by the author, albeit with a great deal of help from colleagues. I wish to credit Julia Kulon for her expert work in locating, translating, and interpreting Polish materials and Sara Sukhun for her careful help reviewing published Arabic materials pertaining to Jewad Selim that enabled me to reconstruct the sequence of his diary and sketchbook entries. I am grateful to Aglaya Glebova and Przemysław Strożek for conversations around texts and word choices and to Eric Karpeles for help with access to the diaries of Józef Czapski. Finally, I am indebted to Ishtar Hamoudi for sending me scans of materials from her father’s personal archive in Baghdad.

Two notes regarding Selim’s diary warrant mention here. First, when Selim died suddenly in 1961, a diary and an early sketchbook passed into the possession of Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, a Palestinian literary critic who moved to Baghdad in 1948 and became a principal chronicler of Iraqi modern arts. Jabra published selected entries in two venues: the journal <em>Ḥiwār,</em> in February 1964, and a book of collected writings, <em>Al-Riḥla al-Thāmina,</em> in 1967 (hereafter <em>RT</em>). Even though the same entries appear in both publications, the versions in <em>Ḥiwār</em> are slightly more abridged than those in <em>RT</em> (although, in one instance, <em>Ḥiwār</em> contains text not included in <em>RT</em>). I cite page numbers from <em>RT</em>. Second, the date of this particular diary entry, and consequently of the letter, is uncertain. When Jabra published the text <em>Ḥiwār</em>, it carried a 23 September 1943 date; however, in <em>RT,</em> it is dated to 23 July 1943. Contextual references seem consistent with a September date, which I use here. <a href=\"#fnref4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>“Yaʿīsh lil-fann wa-lil-fann faqaṭ.” Jamil Hamoudi, “Mushkilat al-Jīl al-Jadīd,” <em>ʿAshtarūt,</em> no. 3 (1943): 15.

Artist Shakir Hassan Al Said, who had studied with Selim and Faiq Hassan, drew on testimony by Hassan in a 1983 study of Iraqi art movements to emphasize the “indirect,” discursive quality of the Polish impact on Iraqi attitudes.

Drawing on the rich collection of East German samizdat artists’ books in the Getty Research Institute (GRI), this article examines diverse approaches to design integrating photography and poetry that emerged from within this vibrant community, including artistic practices of dialogue across consecutive pages (Wolfgang Henne and Marion Wenzel), montaged works (the artist’s trio of the Günther-Jahn-Bach Editionen), and handwritten poems combined with found photographs, drawing, and overpainting (Inge Müller and Christine Schlegel). The intermedial focus and the limited print-run editions, which—because of a legal loophole—allowed for modest circulation of these largely uncensored materials, enabled artists to speak about controversial issues such as the environment, the legal system, transgenerational feminist solidarities, or accountability for Germany’s Nazi past.","content":"<h2>Introduction: Intermediality in German Democratic Republic Samizdat</h2>\n<p>In the early 1990s, following the collapse of the German Democratic Republic (GDR,1949–89) the Getty Research Institute (GRI) acquired a substantial collection of archives and books from scholars, artists, and curators from the former GDR.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> Among them, a remarkable collection of more than one hundred handcrafted limited-edition artists’ books, magazines, and portfolios produced by small independent presses in the 1980s stands out. This collection was originally assembled by book-art scholar Jens Henkel, coauthor of the foundational bibliography <em>DDR 1980–1989: Künstlerbücher und originalgrafische Zeitschriften im Eigenverlag: Eine Bibliografie</em> (1991; Artists’ books and artists’ magazines serially published by independent presses: a bibliography). While the Henkel collection has been available in GRI special collections since its acquisition in 1993, the scholarly community was not broadly aware of its presence prior to its having been aggregated within the GRI’s Library Catalog under one searchable heading.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>During the Cold War, across the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union, independently (and often clandestinely) produced literature was known as <em>samizdat,</em> after <em>самиздат</em> (self-published) in Russian, or as <em>Eigenverlag</em> (private publishing) in German. Much like in other countries of the Soviet Bloc, there were numerous types of samizdat in the GDR, including environmental samizdat, women’s and LGBTQ samizdat, and the artistic samizdat under discussion here. The GDR’s artistic samizdat of the 1980s represents the collaborative work of a vibrant community of emerging artists experimenting across media who were seeking to communicate with each other while circumventing state-sponsored production, publication, and distribution systems.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> By creating limited print runs (from a handful to fewer than a hundred copies), artists could avoid having to secure official permits, and thus bypassed government censorship.</p>\n<p>Overall, although numerous studies addressing artists’ books and magazines produced by small independent presses in the GDR have been published since the <em>Wende</em> (a term that refers to the dissolution of the GDR and the reunification of Germany), much of this important area of cultural production has yet to be studied, due in part to the vast output of this kind of work, which is, moreover, dispersed across various public and private collections on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>\n<p>Among the samizdat produced in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries, the intermedial character of the samizdat under discussion here stands out as a unique form of artistic expression.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> As a descriptor of innovative artistic production, the term <em>intermedia</em> was first introduced in the mid-1960s by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins to refer to art that “fall(s) conceptually between established or traditional media.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> It more broadly applies to artwork that crosses the boundaries between distinct art media, such as Marcel Duchamp’s readymades, John Heartfield’s graphics combined with photography or American artist Allan Kaprow’s happenings, to produce synthetic or synesthetic experiences.</p>\n<p>Intermediality as an artistic practice in East Germany has been a focus of art historian Sara Blaylock in her monograph, in the context of her discussion of Intermedia I, the legendary festival that took place in Coswig (GDR) in 1985. Blaylock argues that while the conceptual framework for intermedial art in East Germany was consistent in many respects with the term’s inception in the writings of Higgins, its theoretical grounding with particular respect to the East German situation was enhanced and shaped not only by art events such as the Intermedia I festival but also through discussions conducted in the art journal Bildende Kunst (Visual art), which, in 1981 and between April and June 1982, published several articles on the topic and even devoted a whole issue to experimental art forms in 1988.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup></p>\n<p>Blaylock points out how in 1989 in East Germany art historian Eugen Blume teamed up with Christoph Tannert, co-organizer of the Coswig Intermedia I festival, to put together the pathbreaking Permanente Kunstkonferenz (Permanent Art Conference), demonstrating that there was a “vast movement toward a different kind of cultural practice being led by artists and art professionals,” despite the authorities’ attempt to undermine such developments.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<p>This vast movement developed over the years out of a legal loophole that allowed visual artists to reproduce up to ninety-nine copies without official permits. As book art scholar and East German samizdat collector Reinhard Grüner explains, writers who had limited opportunities to publish their work took advantage of this loophole by embedding their texts into visual or graphic works; this intermedial collaboration provided a platform for writers to publish their work as integral art forms rather than as literary texts, leading to new and autonomous ways of artistic expression that could circumvent censorship.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup></p>\n<p>Since the early 1980s, the samizdat artists in the Henkel collection collaboratively combined a wide variety of media art, integrating texts (poetry and literature) with printmaking, photography, music scores, and performance-art documentation; they did this while borrowing styles and techniques from various twentieth-century artistic movements in the service of making work that suited their purposes and turned out to be, nevertheless, very much of its moment. While the artists often reclaimed prewar art forms such as German expressionism, Dada, surrealism, and abstraction, they integrated these with more recent forms of concrete poetry, conceptual art, and plein-air actions.</p>\n<p>Highlighting the GRI’s collection, this article draws inspiration from the scholarship on the intermedial nature of these self-published works. The works are characterized by the deliberate combination and juxtaposition of different graphic media—including printmaking, collage, and photography—with texts to create dynamic combinations of at times incongruous and polyvalent visual and textual narratives.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reflecting a variety of art media, the Henkel samizdat collection contains a gamut of contents and formats, sizes, materials, aesthetics, styles, and designs. From books in simple leporello formats, such as Manfred Butzmann’s series of juxtaposed photographs <em>19 Schaufenster in Pankow</em> (1989, Nineteen shopwindows in Pankow), to the magnum opus of technical assemblage and multisensory reading titled <em>Unaulutu: Steinchen im Sand: Ein Malerbuch</em> (Unaulutu: Pebbles in sand: An artist’s book) by Frieder Heinze and Olaf Wegewitz, these works defy easy categorization. Still, the material is rich in evidence of artists working together across different media, composing narratives that integrated images, poetry, and prose, and sometimes music in the form of accompanying tapes or scores. Because the objects that they produced were unsanctioned limited editions, they were compelled to make do with the kind of printing tools that were readily available. Accordingly, their output has a characteristically raw, uniquely handmade look. The bindings of books and journals might be fastened by staples on the central-fold spine, glued with stationery store supplies, or elegantly stitched in the Japanese style. Multiple copies of texts were mostly reproduced with carbon paper on a typewriter or by mimeograph. Xeroxing was used only rarely, when artists could access photocopiers, which were closely regulated by Eastern European regimes during the Cold War.</p>\n<p>The case studies in this article examine especially the intermedial relationship between photography and poetry in different approaches that take into account both prewar avant-garde art forms and contemporaneous art movements and trends. The status of these experimental works in the longer history of European art movements has to be considered in terms of their particular historical context; these works were created, for the most part, collaboratively under the unusual conditions of working on the margins of or parallel to the East German art system and publishing industry. In art historical terms, this samizdat emerged during the heyday of postmodernism in Europe and the United States, which was frowned upon by GDR officials, and to which some of the artists in question were exposed mostly through German translations of works by French theorists such as Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault smuggled in from West Berlin by friends. Indeed, for some poets, including Bert Papenfuß-Gorek, Rainer Schedlinski, or Hans-Joachim Schulze, postmodernism provided theoretical frameworks for critiquing official East German discourse in their poetry and essays.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup></p>\n<p>More significantly still, the emergence of East German samizdat also coincides with the integration of modernist and avant-garde movements into the state’s official canon—a convoluted process that began with de-Stalinization in 1956, was negotiated at the 1963 Kafka conference in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, and culminated in Erich Honecker’s proclamation in 1971 that there would be no more taboos in the GDR’s cultural production.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> This relaxation was not unconditional, as the expulsion of East German songwriter and poet Wolf Biermann in 1976 served as a demonstration of the limitations on artistic expressions. Yet the 1980s saw the publication of numerous studies devoted to movements that, officially, were previously unsanctioned—from German expressionism to surrealism and Dada—on which, as already mentioned, the samizdat production in question draws. While a precise anchoring of this oeuvre in relation to discourses of modernism, postmodernism, and the (neo-) avant-garde is not possible given the constraints of this essay and the heterogeneity of the oeuvre, [cultural theorist?] Svetlana Boym’s capacious category of the “off-modern”—defined as a “detour into the unexplored potentials of the modern project [that] recovers unforeseen pasts and ventures into the side alleys of modern history at the margins of error of major philosophical, economic, and technological narratives of modernization and progress” (rather than, say, the postmodern captivation with the absurdity of communication)— aptly describes the works’ varying preoccupations with the ruins of the East German project, with the utopian horizons of the historical avant-gardes, or with previous generations of experimental or marginalized authors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> The latter gave rise to transgenerational solidarities, especially among women artists and poets in the GDR, of whom a portion of this article will attend to by discussing the collaborative artworks by Marion Wenzel (with Wolfgang Henne and Steffen Volmer), the influences of classic writers and American artists on the Günther-Jahn-Bach Press, and Christine Schlegel’s engagement with posthumously published poet Inge Müller.</p>\n<h2>Photo-poetry</h2>\n<p>Poetry’s formal succinctness and well-established tradition in the GDR made it an appealing mode of expression for East German samizdat artists of the 1980s.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> But while poetry’s ubiquity in East German samizdat production has attracted a fair amount of scholarly attention, its integration with photography in samizdat publications has been less scrutinized. In contrast to conventional GDR photography, samizdat photography, produced for the most part by a younger generation of photographers born in the 1950s, is characterized by technical and thematic experimentation aligned with that moment’s innovative trends in performance art and conceptual photography.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup></p>\n<p>In East German samizdat, rather than being accompanied by traditional illustrations, poems were often an integral part of the graphic work (such as engraving, etching, relief printing, and serigraphy), etched or carved directly onto the printing plates of original limited-edition prints. Some artists repurposed found photographs, photomechanical prints, and collage as alternative forms of visual poetry. Poetry was also supplemented or enhanced with photographic prints, often reproduced in artists’ books as original gelatin silver prints. What follows will examine East German samizdat’s innovative practice of the intermedial genre of photo-poetry.</p>\n<p>In his recent book on the history of photo-poetry, Michael Nott, citing Nicole Boulestreau’s coinage of the term <em>photopoème</em>, quotes Boulestreau: “In the photopoem, meaning progresses in accordance with the reciprocity of writing and figures: reading becomes interwoven through alternating restitchings of the signifier into text and image.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup> For Nott, Boulestreau suggests that the *photopoème “*should be defined not by its production but its reception, as a practice of reading and looking that relies on the reader/viewer to make connections between, and create meaning from, text and image.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup> Nott outlines the different types of relationships between photograph and poem, those that can be “of disruption and serendipity, appropriation and exchange, evocation and metaphor.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fnref17\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">17</a></sup> Photopoetry, in this sense, challenges the reader to consume a message by interpreting it through reading and looking; the two media (poem and photograph) require distinct vocabularies. This interplay between the visual and textual components invites an interactive and layered engagement with the artwork, and the ensuing process of decoding and interpreting both direct and indirect correspondences can evoke a unique experiential response or stimulate metaphorical understanding.</p>\n<p>Following Nott’s two-pronged emphasis on meaning-making and reception, this study charts three different ways by means of which photo-poetry artists have challenged their audience to decode a message created from the combination of photography and poetic verses. The study also explores the genre’s significance to the generation of GDR artists that produced it. The three different approaches to photo-poetry that will be discussed are: 1) separate juxtapositions of poetry and photography as autonomous, self-directed practices in dialogue within a narrative sequence, across consecutive pages of an artist’s book; 2) montage of photograph and poem into a single work of art; and 3) more elaborate intermedial fusion that combines found photographs with printmaking, painting, and poetic verses transcribed by hand in the context of a poet’s oeuvre as a visual and textual narrative.</p>\n<h2>Landscape as Signs</h2>\n<p>The artist’s book <em>Landschaft als Zeichen, messbar-vermessbar</em> (Landscape as signs, measurable, surveyable) explores the intermedial aesthetics of juxtaposing self-referential forms of poetry with photography. The book was made in Leipzig in 1983 by book artist Wolfgang Henne with printmaker Steffen Volmer and photographer Marion Wenzel. It is in landscape format and bound with four small metal screws reminiscent of mechanical assemblage components. The poetry is typed in Courier on red-lined metric graph paper followed on subsequent pages by original black-and-white photographs of low contrast—ethereal landscapes showing the silhouette of a leafless forest, barely visible in the winter fog, or reflections of reeds in still water, which look like abstracted signs of an illegible language. Within foldouts beneath the photographs there are mounted etchings or embossed prints in pairs (by Henne or Vollmer) of abstract compositions that visually render the themes of nature and artifice as coexisting, complementary, or conflicting worlds.</p>\n<p>The book explores whether a landscape’s value can be measured, surveyed, or quantified, and is critical of threats to the environment from pollution and the exploitation of natural resources.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup> The three poems call for the recovery and preservation of the natural landscape, addressing nature and culture, as well as the impact of humans on the environment. Henne’s concrete poem “Landschaft” is laid out on graph paper across Cartesian coordinates, for which the horizontal and vertical axes are composed of the repeated plus (+) signs of a typewriter. The grid-based composition evokes the mathematical procedure involved in measuring the value of the landscape, comprising the land and its natural resources (<a href=\"#fig-5-1\">fig. 1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>landscape<br>\nlandscape<br>\nlandscape</p>\n<p>landscape<br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5rem\">’s</span><br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5rem\">spaces</span><br>\n<span style=\"margin-left: 5rem\">dreams</span></p>\n<p>landscape in emigration</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The words of the poem are typed abutting the vertical axis of plus signs on both sides, with the final phrase traversing it, running from the top-left quadrant toward the bottom-right quadrant. The word <em>landschaft</em> (landscape) is repeated four times on top; with a vertical line of eight plus signs linking the first letter of the third and fourth, creating a box, perhaps to suggest the parceling of land. The layout physically embodies the notion of measured spaces, which beneath the horizontal axis becomes “landscapes’ spaces” and then dreams. In the last line, landscape is linked to emigration, which might be read literally or symbolically.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup></p>\n<p>Two pages later, Wenzel’s striking, meditative photograph shows a river in a misty, hibernal light (<a href=\"#fig-5-2\">fig. 2</a>). Wenzel has said that she was interested in capturing the mood and the beauty of nature, the light, and structural composition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup> Flowing through a snow-covered field, the river cuts across from the top left of the frame toward the bottom right margin. The image contrast is so low that the horizon line between the earth and the sky is almost invisible. In the foreground, animal footprints in the snow appear as signs of a past presence, evoking passage and movement. As a visual correspondence with Henne’s verse “landscape in emigration,” these signs could subtly allude to the subject of emigration, rarely discussed openly in the GDR, where the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961 significantly curbed freedom of movement, particularly the right to travel to the West.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-5-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/horakova-poggi-01.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 1. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Wolfgang Henne (German, b. 1949).</strong> “Landschaft,” typescript on graph paper, 15 × 15 cm (including white margin).

But Henne’s combined use of graph paper and photography creates a multilayered narrative, enhanced by the use of papers of different colors or textures, and interactions among different media. The book’s layout enfolds additional imagery with original prints hidden within foldouts, which impart a dynamic rhythm to the haptic experience of finding covert pathways, correspondences, discoveries, and reflections. While the two media of poetry and photography, having been printed on different pages of the book, are not directly juxtaposed, the book’s objective is to invite the viewer/reader to unfold its intermedial dynamic by meditating on one work at a time.</p>\n<h2>Text / Image Equivalences</h2>\n<p>A more elaborate approach to the creation of photo-poems can be found in the work of the artists’ group Günther-Jahn-Bach Editionen, which for the most part conjoins the two media through montage techniques: the typed text was projected onto film negatives after which the image was printed as an integrated work of art.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup> The trio’s <em>foto-lyrik arbeiten</em> (photo-poetry works) were devised in the late 1970s by Weimar-based photographer Claus Bach and Berlin-based poet Thomas Günther, who were soon joined by printmaker Sabine Jahn. Born in Thuringia in the 1950s and friends since high school, the artists produced special editions together throughout the 1980s. Thomas Günther (1952–2018), the group’s poet, had been imprisoned at the age of seventeen for running a student reading club and protesting the repression of the Prague Spring. After his release, he moved to Potsdam, where he worked as a gardener at the Sanssouci Palace and, from 1974 to 1977, as a <em>Regieassistent</em> (assistant director) at the Berliner Ensemble, the theater company founded by Bertolt Brecht. Throughout the 1980s, Günther was a caretaker at the Georgen-Parochial-Friedhof I in East Berlin, pursuing his art collaborations within the unconventional space of the cemetery wherein he is now buried.</p>\n<p>Günther’s papers at the GRI provide unique archival documentation of the poet’s artistic production in the 1980s, including works that, on account of their provocative subjects, could not find an official publication venue at the time, such as the photo-poem “Das Gesetz” (The law) (<a href=\"#fig-5-3\">fig. 3</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> On the verso of the photographic print, Günther annotated this piece with the phrase “nach Kafka” (after Kafka), referring to the writer’s short story “Vor dem Gesetz” (“Before the Law”), which recounts an individual’s inability to tackle the law. Composed in 1981, Günther’s poem was printed on transparent adhesive paper, mounted on top of a photograph taken by Claus Bach for this purpose, and then rephotographed. Bach photographed the Schönhauser Allee subway station in East Berlin dramatically framed from the street under the elevated rail tracks, looking up toward the subway bridge. From this angle, the station appears as a colossal structure, an overwhelming receptacle, which dominates almost the entire field of vision. The imposing structure overtakes a pedestrian, barely visible through the entrance. Here the human figure appears on the verge of being swallowed by “the law,” or unable to break through its system.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-5-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/horakova-poggi-03.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-3\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 3. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Thomas Günther (German, b. 1952), poetry, and Claus Bach (German , b. 1956), photograph.</strong> <em>Das Gesetz</em> (The law), gelatin silver print, 30.5 × 23 cm.

The verse highlights the norms of the law that compel one to stay on the collective path, avoiding the “intricate ways” that would make one “go astray and so become guilty in the name of the law.” In the poet’s words, “loners are not in demand” in a system where the law is a “line” that requires one to walk on without “stepping outside” of it.

Artaud’s line synthesizes the trio’s artistic vision: “Parce qu’on a eu peur que leur poésie ne sorte des livres et ne renverse la réalité” (“Because they were afraid that their poetry might leap out of the books and overthrow reality”). The quotation, a sentence that Artaud wrote with reference to the surrealist poets’ movement, amplifies the power of poetry to overthrow reality, recontextualized here for the trio’s artistic purposes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> If in “Das Gesetz” poetry is used to warn the reader about the restrictions of “the line of the law,” here it is presented as a powerful subversive tool.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup></p>\n<p>Abstracting the perspectival view of the trio’s manifesto, Jahn designed the cover of the portfolio <em>Traumhaus</em>, a set of twelve <em>foto-lyrik arbeiten</em> by Günther and Bach (<a href=\"#fig-5-5\">fig. 5</a>). The cover depicts four triangles, two yellow ones on top and bottom, and two green ones on the sides, converging on a carefully designed vanishing point at the center of the image, like Günther’s felt hat. The capitalized title (TRAUMHAUS) is printed in red and runs across the green triangles, with the point of convergence being not the inner points of the green triangles but the letter <em>H,</em> bounding the point of convergence between the yellow triangles. Treated as a grapheme, the letter can be read as joining or separating the words to its sides, creating a double meaning. <em>Traumhaus,</em> which translates as “dream house,” evokes an ideal dream space. However, in reading the words on the green background without the connecting H, the German “Traum aus” translates as “the dream” (presumably to build a utopian world) “is over”.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-5-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/horakova-poggi-05.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-5\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 5. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Sabine Jahn (German, b. 1955).</strong> Cover design for <em>Traumhaus,</em> 1988–89, screen print, h.: 61 cm.

In 1987, upon finding a catalog of black-and-white photographs of flowers by American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, Jahn felt that these images, in her own words, “screamed for color,” and she proceeded to create a set of five screen prints that transformed Mapplethorpe’s flowers by infusing the forms with brightly saturated color in a high-contrast, pop-art style that simplified and enhanced the flowers’ core shapes.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> According to Jahn, she was inspired by the work of two prominent women artists, Georgia O’Keeffe and Patti Smith, who were powerful not only on account of their own artistic creativity but also because of the creative synergies that ensued from working with their partners, photographers Alfred Stieglitz and Robert Mapplethorpe, respectively.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fnref28\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">28</a></sup> Jahn conceived this portfolio as an homage to all four artists, highlighting their interconnected creative relationships by combining appropriated images and texts from all of them. For example, in one plate, Jahn combined a poem by Smith with a painting by O’Keeffe. Jahn further expressed her admiration for these artists’ collaborative partnerships by continuing to produce intermedial work over several decades with her own partner, Thomas Günther.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fnref29\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">29</a></sup></p>\n<p>In addition to the bold colored flowers, Jahn made a screen print reinterpreting a portrait of O’Keeffe, appropriating a photograph by Stieglitz, which shows the painter sitting on the floor next to her palette while looking back at the camera. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fnref30\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">30</a></sup> On the empty visual field created by the area of her skirt, Jahn added text written by hand, a German translation of O’Keeffe’s poem “I Have Picked Flowers Where I Found Them.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fnref31\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">31</a></sup> Its text is a contemplative commentary on nature and the desert landscape as a source of inspiration (<a href=\"#fig-5-6\">fig. 6</a>). By placing Georgia O’Keeffe’s personal words on the artist’s figure and using screen print with poetry on a reappropriated photograph, Jahn transforms O’Keeffe’s own body into her poetic voice. Jahn’s portfolio also points to the influence of American art from both the prewar figures (such as Stieglitz and O’Keeffe) and contemporary cultural stars such as Patty Smith and Mapplethorpe, whose respective intermedial work (combining images and poetry) is presented in other plates.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-5-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/horakova-poggi-06.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-6\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 6. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Sabine Jahn</strong> <strong>(German, b. 1955)</strong> Screen print after the photograph <em>Portrait of Georgia O’Keeffe</em> (1918, printed 1929/1934) by Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946), 73.3 × 51 cm.

Jah does this not only by engaging with her own group’s members but also by reinterpreting other artists’ works beyond spatiotemporal boundaries through her own highly transformational process.</p>\n<h2>Intergenerational and Feminist Solidarities in <em>Perhaps I Will Suddenly Disappear</em></h2>\n<p>Experimentation and the blurring of conventional distinctions between media and artistic forms—including the fusion of poetry and photography—became the salient feature of the final generation of GDR’s writers. To this end, the young writers looked to the historical avant-garde, notably Dadaist practices of collage and photomontage and German expressionist draftsmanship and printmaking as well as techniques from neo-avant-garde movements, especially concrete and visual poetry and Fluxus. Drawing on several of these traditions, the artist’s book <em>Vielleicht werde ich plötzlich verschwinden</em> (Perhaps I will suddenly disappear), created in 1986 by Christine Schlegel (b. 1950), combines Schlegel’s collages, drawings, and overpainting treatments with the poetry of the late East German poet Inge Müller (1925–66).</p>\n<p>In addition to being intermedial, Schlegel’s engagement with Müller is also transgenerational, which in the context of the GDR carries both aesthetic as well as political implications. According to literary historian Wolfgang Emmerich’s influential tripartite generational classification of East German writers, the first generation, comprising repatriated antifascists who had fled Germany during the Nazi regime, fervently adhered to socialist realism in service to the task of building socialism.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fnref32\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">32</a></sup> The second generation (born between 1915 and 1935) were, in Emmerich’s view, engaged in the socialist project’s easing of strict socialist-realist criteria for artistic production and availed themselves of predominantly modernist aesthetics. According to Emmerich’s model, the third and final generation (born in the 1950s) assumed an attitude of disassociation (<em>Aussteigertum</em>) from the political or aesthetic projects of its generational predecessors.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fnref33\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">33</a></sup></p>\n<p>Yet while Emmerich’s study provides a nuanced lens through which to read a body of work that spans the forty years of the GDR’s existence, his neat ascriptions of political allegiances and aesthetic norms can also obscure the exchanges, dialogues, and homages that did take place across generational lines, as evidenced by third-generation East German artist Christine Schlegel’s engagement with the poetry of second-generation East German writer Inge Müller. In addition, Emmerich’s conjecture—that the final generation of East German writers had no interest in the East German project whatsoever—coincides perhaps too neatly with the post-Wall marginalization of East German culture in Germany today, where many rich and incisive works produced in the GDR continue to be overlooked.</p>\n<p>Both Schlegel and Müller were already marginalized in the GDR on account of their status as women artists. Their work, moreover, straddled officially sanctioned and unsanctioned GDR culture of the 1960s and 1980s, respectively, and was subsequently written out of the canon in post-reunified Germany.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fnref34\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">34</a></sup> Though Schlegel had studied painting and graphic design at the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden from 1973 to 1978, was a member of the official artists’ union (Künstlerverband), and had her work included in official exhibitions, the artist viewed the official expectations placed on art as “dictatorial” and became involved in the unofficial artistic scene.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fnref35\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">35</a></sup> She regularly contributed to the unofficial journals <em>und</em>, <em>usw.,</em> and <em>Mikado</em>, designed the cover of <em>ariadnefabrik</em> (ariadne factory), and created posters for various underground events such as poetry readings, before emigrating to West Berlin in 1986. Schlegel has also attributed her marginalization in the GDR to the well-documented exclusion of women artists from the country’s artistic underground (with Raja Lubinetzki and Gabriele Stötzer as notable exceptions), and to the general position of women in the socialist state, in which women’s emancipation was an officially pursued goal that fell short in practicality on issues such as the double burden.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fnref36\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">36</a></sup></p>\n<p>Schlegel came across Müller when, in 1986, twenty years after Müller’s death, a volume of her poetry titled <em>Wenn ich schon sterben muß</em> (If I do have to die) was being prepared for publication with the official press Aufbau. The volume was overseen by Dresden-based poet and publisher Richard Pietraß, who also lent Schlegel all of Müller’s texts from which to choose for her artist’s book.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fnref37\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">37</a></sup> <em>Vielleicht werde ich plötzlich verschwinden</em> thus came into existence contemporaneously with the official publication of Müller’s poetry.</p>\n<p>Born in 1925 in Berlin as Inge Meyer, the author’s youth was dominated by life in the Third Reich and the Second World War. From 1942 until 1945, she was drafted into Nazi war efforts, first working as an agricultural laborer, then as a maid in a Nazi officer’s household (reportedly on account of her “political unreliability”), and eventually, in January 1945, as a <em>Luftwaffehelferin</em> or <em>Flakhelferin</em> (assistant to the German air force).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fnref38\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">38</a></sup> Shortly before the liberation of Berlin, Meyer’s parents died in a bombing orchestrated by the German air force against the approaching Red Army, while Meyer herself spent three days trapped underneath a collapsing building. The traumas of the war resurface periodically in Müller’s biography—she died in 1966 by suicide after numerous attempts following the end of the war—and in her work.</p>\n<p>In the fledgling GDR, Müller, who joined East Germany’s communist party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, SED; Socialist Unity Party) in 1948, worked as a journalist, and became a successful children’s author. With her third husband, renowned East German playwright Heiner Müller, whom she married in 1955, Inge Müller cowrote several theater plays, notably <em>Der Lohndrücker</em> (1957; The wage shark) and <em>Die Korrektur</em> (1961; The correction). The latter led to Heiner Müller’s expulsion from the official writers’ union and a publishing ban in the same year, which by association extended to Inge Müller, and which Ines Geipel describes as the “beginning of the radical unraveling of Inge Müller’s life.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fnref39\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">39</a></sup> While Heiner Müller eventually earned a considerable international reputation along with which he regained his standing in the GDR, the 1986 volume was the first significant publication of Inge Müller’s work in the GDR following the 1961 ban.</p>\n<p>Schlegel was “touched and inspired” by Müller’s poetry, which she “decidedly liked” and found “absolutely contemporary” (“absolut zeitgemäß”), even more than twenty years after it had been written.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fnref40\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">40</a></sup> She felt drawn to the poet’s thematic preoccupations, including environmental concerns and the “vulnerability of nature”; friendship; and death; as well as the “concision,” “economy,” and “clarity” of Müller’s poetic language that, nevertheless, gives its readers the “whole picture.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fnref41\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">41</a></sup> Interestingly, while the two artists belong to different generations, the building of the Berlin Wall in August 1961 represents a caesura in their lives and their respective relationship to the state: while for Müller, it coincided with the publishing ban in the volatile atmosphere of the Wall’s construction, Schlegel identifies the building of the Berlin Wall as a watershed moment of her childhood, after which the situation in the GDR took a turn for the worse.</p>\n<p><em>Vielleicht werde ich plötzlich verschwinden</em> (Perhaps I will suddenly disappear), titled after a poem by Müller, contains a selection of twelve poems, handwritten by Schlegel and distributed over the book’s thirty pages. The poems are at times juxtaposed with illustrations, at times integrated into adjacent drawings, and on several occasions combined into photo-poems. The artist’s book is gathered in a Japanese binding with a black-and-blue cover that bears the title, as well as Schlegel’s and Müller’s names, in hand-drawn lettering and embedded in an organic composition that mixes abstract and figurative elements (<a href=\"#fig-5-7\">fig. 7</a>). The composition is organized around what can be recognized as an outstretched hand, which might allude to the de-skilled artistic gesture. Its rough finish recalls both the visual vocabulary of the pictorial movement <em>art informel</em> and an earlier tradition of expressionist woodcuts. The volume was among several artists’ books produced by the Malerbücher Eigenverlag (Self-published Artists’ Books) under the auspices of Sascha Anderson, the artistic impresario of the GDR’s unofficial art scene and, as it was later revealed, a prolific Stasi informant, who had also approached Schlegel about creating the artist’s book, although the choice of Müller’s poetry and themes remained, in Schlegel’s testimony, her own decision.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fnref42\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">42</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-5-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/horakova-poggi-07.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 7. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Christine Schlegel (German, b. 1950).</strong> Cover of <em>Vielleicht werde ich plötzlich verschwinden</em> (Perhaps I will suddenly disappear), 1986, 36.8 × 25 cm.

All three selections combine Müller’s poetry with group photographs to negotiate themes such as national and familial accountability for the Second World War, the role of women in the Third Reich, and the relationship between the Nazi past and the new sociality of the GDR.</p>\n<h3>Family Photographs, Unsettled</h3>\n<p>In its creative overpainting and overdrawing of an appropriated photograph and Müller’s eponymous poem, Schlegel’s rendering of “Drei Fragen hinter der Tür” layers national and familial memories (<a href=\"#fig-5-8\">fig. 8</a>). The spread displays a photograph of the Monument to the Battle of the Nations (Völkerschlachtdenkmal, completed in 1913) in Leipzig, a controversial site commemorating an 1813 battle fought between Prussia and its allies against Napoleon that in its embodiment of <em>völkisch</em> (ethnonationalist) motifs “revealed the growth of a popular nationalism” that was later mythologized by the Nazis.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fnref43\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">43</a></sup> Before the monument, a group of five people, ostensibly women, can be seen posing for the camera.

[Poetry credit line TK.]</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>If the group is supposed to be cast as female, the upper half of the image of the monument is coded as male, signified by a headless, nude male figure drawn hovering above the group, Schlegel’s addition of stark outlines around the statues of soldiers on the memorial, and the delineation of the phallic shape of the memorial itself. The masculinist investiture of the monument is countermanded by the painted lines, through which Müller has crossed out and obscured portions of the memorial and rendered the hovering male figure as decapitated alongside the quasi-decapitated memorial itself, whose photograph has been cut off at the top in the page layout. Müller’s poem is created in a white space within black paint outlines on the opposite page that echoes the shape of the memorial and likewise resembles a decapitated torso, mirroring the headless monument on the right page. The poem takes the perspective of a child, who is unaware of the bygone cheer of the poem’s addressee behind a “door” reminiscent of the fairy tale “Bluebeard”:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p lang=\"de\">DREI FRAGEN HINTER DER TÜR<br>\naus Kindertagen<br>\nund Du hast gelacht<br>\ngestern vor zweitausend Jahren</p>\n<p>THREE QUESTIONS BEHIND THE DOOR<br>\nfrom childhood days<br>\nand you laughed<br>\nyesterday two thousand years ago</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The work stages and subverts what historian Mary Fulbrook terms the “biological essentialism” of the Nazis, which attributed fundamentally different roles to those men and women deemed to be part of the Nazis’ racialized community, and at once turns historically victimized women into perpetrators. It encounters this past, moreover, as something inaccessible, concentrated in the background of the image that Schlegel nevertheless proceeds to excavate.</p>\n<p>If the past in “Drei Fragen hinter der Tür” seems to be obscured, it is foregrounded in a photo-poem of a found family photograph that Schlegel combined with verses from Müller’s poem “Der verlorene Sohn (1941)” (<a href=\"#fig-5-9\">fig. 9</a>). The photograph features a seated woman—likely the mother—surrounded by five children. The crux of the image is undoubtedly a boy wearing a Prussian military uniform, who is also the only figure that Schlegel leaves unmodified. The remaining figures are given a spectral presence with spidery lines tracing their silhouettes or, in the case of the mother, with Müller’s poem, which thematizes family-sanctioned sacrifice of children as soldiers toward the end of the war, with words and phrases such as “parents” (“Eltern”), “betrayal of the country” (“Landesverat” [sic.]), “he killed” (“tötete er”), and “his brother” (“seinen Bruder”) written across her head and clothing. The work confronts the viewer with the past head-on, mobilizing the uncomfortable frontality of the image in a manner reminiscent of German artist Gerhard Richter’s painting <em>Uncle Rudi</em> (1965) and foregrounding the connection between Prussian militarism and the Second World War.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fnref45\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">45</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-5-9\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-9\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/horakova-poggi-09.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5-9\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 9. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Christine Schlegel (German, b. 1950), artwork, and Inge Müller (German, 1925–66), poetry.</strong> Found photograph of family portrait and fragments of verses from “Der verlorene Sohn (1941)” (The lost son [1941]) by Inge Müller, mixed media, 36.8 × 47 cm.

[Poetry credit line TK.]</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>The poem claims that attempts by poets to describe friendship fall short because they have given up on their task “to analyze power”—a phrase that, due to the ambiguity of the original German, can also be translated as the “power to analyze.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fnref46\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">46</a></sup> Instead, the poem predicates friendship as a diachronic alliance between the poetic ego, “the dead,” the antifascists (those who “refused the command”), and antiauthoritarians. In so doing, it recalls the utopian, antifascist aspirations under the auspices of which the GDR had been founded, countering the erasure of previous emancipatory and antiauthoritarian histories. This erasure, one can say, is visualized by Schlegel’s scratching out of Müller’s text, as though it had been done by the feet of the solemn group above.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn47\" id=\"fnref47\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">47</a></sup> Schlegel thus might be trying to rescue not only moments of resistance and utopianism that she felt the East German project had abandoned with the building of the Berlin Wall but also the poetry of a censored yet prescient Müller.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The three collaborative exchanges examined here are quite different in nature and process. Henne selected photographs that had been taken by Wenzel because they responded to his artistic sensibility.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn48\" id=\"fnref48\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">48</a></sup> Günther, Bach, and Jahn worked together, creating dynamic montages with photographs often deliberately staged to accommodate poetry or altered to visually enhance it. Schlegel worked instead as a visual artist engaging with found photographs and poetry.</p>\n<p>Yet the use of poetry and photography to communicate between the lines empowered these young GDR poets and artists to challenge the official cultural mandates that organized artistic media in compartmentalized ways. Their intermedial art opened up new possibilities for bypassing censorship and addressing taboo subjects, summoning the visual and linguistic power of poetry to challenge the East German collective imaginary. As the present case studies show, this art addressed, for instance, the beauty of the natural landscape threatened by industrial pollution and environmental decay in the work of Henne and Wenzel; the urban, everyday public space and personal experience of East Berlin (Günther, Bach, and Jahn); and connections to the country’s historical legacies and wartime traumas in the integrated work of Müller and Schlegel.</p>\n<p>Especially striking in this body of work is the recourse of multiple women artists to the genre of photo-poetry, whether to transmit concerns about the fragility of nature (Wenzel), explore transnational aesthetic allegiances (in works by Jahn), or enact intergenerational solidarities with marginalized women authors (in Schlegel). If for Artaud the new poetry had the power to “leap out of the books to overthrow reality,” the examples discussed above show how this work generated a uniquely intermedial language, giving rise to artistic networks and influences across generations and international borders. It is thanks to exchanges and collaborations such as these that the last generation of East German artists could develop their voices that broke through not only aesthetic and geographic barriers but also through social and political taboos.</p>\n<p class=\"grj-contributor-bio\">TK</p>\n<p class=\"grj-contributor-bio\">TK</p>\n<h2 class=\"notes-heading\">Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"backmatter\">The authors thank Skyler Arndt-Briggs, Barton Byg, and other faculty at the National Endowment for the Humanities Summer Institute program “Culture in the Cold War: East German Art, Music and Film at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in June–July 2018; the Deutsche Film-Aktiengesellschaft Film Library at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and Carl Gelderloos (Binghamton University [SUNY]) for their invaluable contributions to the project.

The emergence of East German artistic samizdat in the late 1970s to early 1980s is credited in part to the vastly demoralizing impact that the 1976 expatriation of singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann had on the emerging generation of East German artists, as well as to a loophole created by the “Bildende Kunst” bill from 31 August 1971, which postulated that editions of graphic artworks comprising more than one hundred copies had to be officially approved; the bill unwittingly shielded small-scale interdisciplinary projects from the censor.

Although it bears no signature or stamp, comparison with a drawing based on the photograph made it possible to determine its authorship. This article explores connections with other panoramic images produced in the country in order to propose a framework for thinking about the representation of landscapes and cities according to the panoramic tradition, as well as the question of unknown authorship in photography.","content":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>There has been a particularly close and fruitful relationship between photography and the Brazilian landscape and context dating back even prior to the official announcement of the medium’s invention in France in 1839. Although the daguerreotype reached Brazilian shores only six months after its debut, one of the pioneers of the attempt to immortalize light outside of Europe, Hercules Florence, was already living and developing photographic experiments in that region of South America.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> When Emperor Dom Pedro II learned of the invention by the arrival of the first daguerreotypist in Brazil in 1840—the abbot Louis Compte—he was so fascinated that he became an amateur photographer and collector.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> But it would be, more than anything, Brazil’s perceived exoticism, its infinite landscapes, and its cultural diversity that would attract a large number of foreign, mostly European, photographers; they would produce, during the course of the nineteenth century alone, a photographic body of work as extensive and important as it is unexplored or even unknown or unidentified.</p>\n<p>In this context, the present article examines a photographic panorama—an elevated view of a landscape or city formed by the seamless piecing together of multiple overlapping photographic images—of the city of Salvador, captured in six parts around 1880 by German-born photographer Rodolpho Lindemann; the panorama was recently added to the collection of the Getty Research Institute (GRI) in Los Angeles and is now part of the GRI’s collection of photographs of Brazil and Latin America more generally.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> Despite its unique characteristics, this panorama has not been mentioned in previous studies or in the foremost books on the history of photography in Brazil, suggesting that its existence has not been widely known.</p>\n<p>The mass availability of photography in the mid-nineteenth century not only facilitated a broader proliferation of urban views—which already had a significant pictorial presence—but also reinforced the need to document cities. Its proliferation garnered new opportunities to experiment with increasingly sophisticated formats and multiplied the technical possibilities of the medium. Indeed, it was only a few short years after the announcement of the daguerreotype that panoramic photography made its first appearance.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> The photographic camera was initially seen as a scientific device with the ability to document reality, and panoramic photography only intensified this attribute, depicting the totality through elevation, distance, and broad visual coverage. The latter technology, which produced large-scale images, was intended to convey not only a total view but also a specific idea of power inherited from pictorial panoramas;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> the total representation of landscapes and cities—at first seemingly innocuous—is directly related to the colonial and imperialist policies imposed on the spaces depicted. This is one of the many reasons why Brazilian photography is a fascinating case.</p>\n<p>The circulation of these panoramic photos and their connections with other paintings and photographs allow us to reexamine concepts linked to the mobility of images and their relationships with objects and institutions proposed by American art theorist Jonathan Crary and Spanish art historian Ana María Guash, as well as to reflect on the photographic archive as a theoretical and discursive concept, following the ideas of Allan Sekula, American artist and theorist.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> These ideas are also related to American anthropologist Deborah Poole’s notion of “visual economy,” according to which images can be considered “as part of a comprehensive organization of people, ideas, and objects.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Photographic Panoramas and their Derivations</h2>\n<p>A substantial number of photographers from across Europe relocated to Brazil during the nineteenth century, where they worked professionally in a wide range of fields and produced remarkable bodies of work. These photographers captured nearly everything, including portraits, landscapes, urban panoramas, and social documentation, and their images appeared in important scientific publications and international exhibitions.</p>\n<p>In the case of Rodolpho Frederico Francisco Lindemann, who was born in Germany in the mid-1850s, Brazil would become his home in the 1870s. Upon his arrival, the photographer settled in the city of Salvador in the state of Bahia. In 1882, Lindemann was hired as a studio assistant to the prominent Swiss photographer Guilherme Gaensly, and later became his business partner.</p>\n<p>Most of the work by Lindemann known to us today is focused on landscapes, as evidenced by the views and photographs of Salvador that the Baron of Rio Branco included in <em>Álbum de vues du Brésil</em> (Album of views of Brazil), an appendix to the book <em>Le Brésil</em> (Brazil), published in Paris in 1889 by Emile Levasseur.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> Lindemann was one of the artists with the most photographs reproduced in this publication, with a total of twenty-five views, twenty of which are of Salvador. This publication was produced under the auspices of the Comitê Franco-Brasileiro para a Exposição Universal de Paris (Franco-Brazilian Committee for the Paris Universal Exposition) of 1889 and the photographs used were part of the Brazilian pavilion at the event, where Lindemann and Gaensly exhibited photos of Bahia and Pernambuco.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> During his years in Brazil, Lindemann also took photographic views in other provinces such as Alagoas, as well as a number of portraits, a common practice during the latter half of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<p>In the early 1890s, Gaensly moved to the city of São Paulo to open a branch of the Gaensly &amp; Lindemann studio, while Lindemann assumed responsibility for the photographic studio in Bahia. Fotografía Lindemann (Lindemann Photography) was eventually sold to a merchant in 1906, and the photographer and his wife appear to have left Brazil. Although there is no information regarding the date of Lindemann’s death or the fate of his photographic archive, some of his photographs are now located at the Instituto Moreira Salles (Moreira Salles Institute) in São Paulo, Brazil.</p>\n<p>Despite Lindemann’s presumably extensive body of work and his prominent role in Salvador at the time, it is often difficult to access the photographs taken by photographers of those years. Not only was there little awareness about the importance of preserving photographic archives and photos as historically significant objects in the day, but, in many cases, the prints sold by the photographers themselves were not signed, making it even more difficult to identify and access them today.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> This is the case for the panoramic photograph by Lindemann recently acquired by the GRI. The large six-part folding object depicts the coastline of Salvador as seen from the Forte São Marcelo (São Marcelo Fort), a historic structure facing the city center (<a href=\"#fig-6-1\">fig. 1</a>).</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-6-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/pestarino-01.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 1. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Rodolpho Lindemann (German-born, 1852–?).</strong> Panorama of Salvador, ca. 1880, albumen print, 24 × 159.5 cm.

With research it was possible to determine that it had indeed been made by Lindemann, because the aforementioned <em>Album de vues du Brésil</em> includes a drawing of the coast of Salvador that is captioned as having been based on one of his photos. When the two images are compared, it is possible to see that their content is essentially the same, with the exception of several sailboats and the dramatic rays of sunlight added by the artist (<a href=\"#fig-6-2\">fig. 2</a>). As can be seen, the angle of coverage, the distance to the shore, and the location of the vessels are the same in both views, along with certain elements in the lower-left sector of the two images, corresponding to the dock of the fort and a fragment of its side wall. Brazilian historian of photography Boris Kossoy states that cities included as panoramic views in the <em>Album de vues du Brésil</em> received special treatment to ensure that they reflected the “civilized landscape worthy of export” that the album was intended to convey.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-6-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/pestarino-02.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-2\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 2. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Unknown draftsperson, after Rodolpho Lindemann (German-born, 1852–?).</strong> <em>São Salvador de Bahia, vue prise du Fort do Mar</em> (São Salvador de Bahia, view from Fort do Mar) from <em>Album de vues du Brésil</em> (Paris: Imprimerie A.

The final image demonstrates his high level of technical skill both in taking the types of sequential shots that are seamlessly pieced together and, in particular, producing the extreme sharpness and level of detail. In it, we can see the Elevador Lacerda (Lacerda Elevator, the first urban elevator in the world, inaugurated in 1873); the old Arsenal da Marinha (Arsenal of the Navy); the Teatro São João (São João Theater); and many other structures in what was at the time the second most populous city in Brazil and an important cultural center of the Americas.</p>\n<p>It is not the first panoramic view of Salvador taken by Lindemann from the Forte São Marcelo; a similar image taken around 1875 is located at the Reiss-Engelhorn-Museen in Mannheim, Germany.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> However, the panorama at the GRI is different from this earlier one and others because of its large size: it is 159.5 centimeters long and 24 centimeters high. These dimensions and its sharpness allow us to observe the city in great detail, in particular the buildings overlooking the bay and the vessels sailing along the coast. Because of the large size of this image, when we look more closely at the photograph, small scenes of everyday life in Salvador emerge, such as three men standing on the dock of the fort and people on the coast or aboard different types of boats (<a href=\"#fig-6-3-a\">figs. 3a–c</a>).</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-6-3-a\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--3\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-3-a\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/pestarino-03-a.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-3-a\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 3a</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Rodolpho Lindemann (German-born, 1852–?).</strong> Panorama of Salvador (details), ca. 1880, albumen print, 24 × 159.5 cm.

Many renowned photographers of the period accomplished the feat from that spot. For example, in 1860, British photographer Benjamin Mulock took at least two panoramic photos from the site reflecting very different qualities of execution and reproduction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> Around 1870, a similar six-part panoramic photograph was captured by a still-unknown photographer, and later in the decade, both Ferrez (<a href=\"#fig-6-4-a\">figs. 4a</a>, <a href=\"#fig-6-4-b\">4b</a>) and Gaensly produced their own versions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fnref14\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">14</a></sup> Of all these panoramas with identical viewpoints and visual coverage, the print now at the GRI has the largest dimensions.

Consider, for example, the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1822, French painter Félix-Émile Taunay painted <em>Panorama do Rio de Janeiro</em>, a one-meter-long colored aquatint portraying a very urban view of the city from Morro do Castelo (Castle Hill). This panorama, made in Brazil, was exhibited in 1824 at the Passage des Panoramas (Passageway of Panoramas) in Paris, allowing French spectators to experience, perhaps for the first time, a comprehensive view of the city. A second panoramic depiction was painted around 1830 by Robert Burford, the proprietor of Leicester Square, a space for exhibiting panoramas in London, where it was on display for a year.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fnref15\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">15</a></sup></p>\n<p>Some years later, around 1863, Italian-born photographer Augusto Stahl took a five-part photographic panorama of Rio de Janeiro. The vantage point used for this panorama was the Ilha das Cobras (Isle of Snakes), which would also be used by other photographers, such as Georges Leuzinger in his three-part photographic panorama around 1866 (<a href=\"#fig-6-5\">fig. 5</a>), an image upon which the Spanish artist Enrique Casanova would base his painting <em>Vista do Rio de Janeiro</em> (View of Rio de Janeiro) around 1883 (<a href=\"#fig-6-6\">fig. 6</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fnref16\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">16</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-6-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/pestarino-05.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-5\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 5. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Georges Leuzinger (Swiss-born, 1813–92).</strong> Panorama of Rio de Janeiro, ca. 1866, photogravure, 27.5 × 119.5 cm.

The vision of the new and exotic—for these creators coming from other latitudes—emerges as a historical construction, revealing mechanisms of visual representation explicitly devised first by the painter and later by the photographer. The latter uses the photographic apparatus and its reality effect to reconfigure and reorganize the relationships between the observing subject and modes of representation.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fnref18\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">18</a></sup></p>\n<p>Panoramic photos have a particular technical appeal, and there is a remarkable volume of work in Brazil, where, as seen from the numerous examples mentioned, they were a common practice among landscape photographers. Creating these images was a difficult undertaking: the photographer had to travel to the shooting location with bulky equipment—including heavy cameras, tripods, glass plates—and chemicals, due to the specific characteristics of the wet collodion process, which was in use from the late 1850s until the 1880s, when it was replaced by dry gelatin plates.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fnref19\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">19</a></sup> The resulting prints are different from other photographs: because of their large size, panoramic photos are usually folded, further emphasizing their status as manipulable objects, compared to other smaller or pocket-size photographs (<a href=\"#fig-6-7\">fig. 7</a>). The panoramic photos were private objects, acquired by a select clientele as visual treasures depicting cities in faraway regions of the world in all their detail and splendor.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fnref20\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">20</a></sup></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-6-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/pestarino-07.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 7. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Rodolpho Lindemann’s photographic panorama of Salvador (ca. 1880) unfolded.</strong></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/pestarino-07.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6-7\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Fig. 7. —</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"><strong>Rodolpho Lindemann’s photographic panorama of Salvador (ca. 1880) unfolded.</strong></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Consequently, this type of photographic feat was motivated not only by the adventure of creating images outside of the studio but also by the possibility of selling them as collectible objects. The primary buyers were foreigners visiting or living in Brazil on a temporary basis. These images thus traveled to different countries and ended up becoming part of public libraries and private archives, largely in Europe. Historian Gilberto Ferrez states that the quality of the Brazilian photographs is fully comparable to those produced in other parts of the world; the difference lies in the actual accessibility of such photographs taken in Brazil.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fnref21\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">21</a></sup> Given their itinerant nature and the lack of markings, signatures, or stamps, we still have not been able to determine the authorship of many such extant photos or even the present location of those that may be lost, stored without names in private collections, or forgotten in libraries in distant countries.</p>\n<h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>\n<p>Photographic theory has made it clear that nothing in a photograph is neutral.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fnref22\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">22</a></sup> As Colombian art historian Juanita Solano-Roa states, formats and spaces for circulation and conservation imbue each photograph with meanings that transcend realistic depiction.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fnref23\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">23</a></sup> In the case of panoramic photographs, the view from above or at a distance is a vision with the power to dominate. These images play an important historical role, for they allow us to observe elements that are difficult to see in other representations, such as the layout of cities, specific streets, their buildings, advertisements, and other urban features of a city in a certain period. Nevertheless, as Kossoy argues, photographic images are not only born ideologized but also accumulate ideological components as the photographs are omitted from historical records or reused for different purposes throughout their trajectories.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fnref24\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">24</a></sup></p>\n<p>In this sense, the panoramic photograph by Lindemann shows the urban landscape toward the end of the colonial period in one of Brazil’s most important cities, much of whose identity was constructed around its geographical and architectural characteristics. The relocation and identification of this photograph leads, at least, to two contributions. As mentioned above, the photograph itself offers a wealth of details about its moment in Salvador, making it an exceptional historical visual source. Further, although there are other images from around the same time that depict the city using similar vantage points, restoring the authorship of Lindemann’s photograph contributes to our understanding of the history of the medium, as well as its uses, derivations, and functions.</p>\n<p>This item cannot be understood in isolation. As demonstrated, it is part of a genealogy of panoramic images that—whether in painting, drawing, or photography—are in dialogue with one another. Following Poole, viewers can locate a “combination of relationships of referral and exchange among images themselves, and the social and discursive relations connecting image-makers and consumers”—what Poole determines to be an “image world” that is mutually reinforcing.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fnref25\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">25</a></sup> As was already the case in the nineteenth century, individuals see and produce images on the basis of prior knowledge.</p>\n<p>Equally, there is a material aspect of the panoramic photographs analyzed here. These large photos travel as folded objects, which are treasured, sold, forgotten, and rediscovered. Because of their physical characteristics, they must be unfolded in order to assume full form and allow the observation of their subject. The drawing included in <em>Álbum de vues du Brésil</em> (see <a href=\"#fig-6-2\">fig. 2</a>) is an image that can be easily and readily accessed, but the panoramic photograph on which it was based remained stored—folded—in a private collection in Europe and was later sold in California.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fnref26\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">26</a></sup> It is not possible to trace all its drifts since its creation, but its latest movement to the GRI’s collection made possible to study it and demonstrate that the best place for a nineteenth-century photograph is in a library or archive open to the public, allowing researchers and curators, as well as any other interested person, to learn of its existence and have access to it. Never losing sight of the fact that, as American art historians Rosalind Krauss, Alan Trachtenberg, and Sekula argue, every archive complies with certain standards as a technology of power in which ownership remains paramount,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fnref27\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">27</a></sup> this type of change in location enables us to re-engage with Lindemann’s object and continue to unfold the multiple pages of photographic history. The very characteristics of the medium of photography—elusive and at times forgotten—will ensure that it will always be a diverse history—one that is never finished, being perpetually constructed and reconfigured.</p>\n<p class=\"grj-contributor-bio\"><strong>Julieta Pestarino</strong> is an anthropologist and holds a PhD in History and Theory of the Arts from the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>\n<h2 class=\"notes-heading\">Notes</h2>\n<p class=\"backmatter\">I would like to thank the Getty Foundation and Idurre Alonso, curator of Latin American Art at the Getty Research Institute, for giving me the opportunity to be a Getty Graduate Intern in 2021–22 in the Curatorial Department and to work on significant Latin American artworks and collections and the acquisition of the photographic panorama by Rodolpho Lindemann.

Pedro II was fourteen years old when he first learned of the daguerreotype. He was so enthusiastic that he soon acquired the necessary equipment to take photographs himself, which, according to Gilberto Ferrez, made him the first Brazilian to produce daguerreotypes. Throughout his life, he collected photographs of views of Brazil, as well as portraits of relatives and friends, which he kept in albums. See Gilberto Ferrez, <em>A fotografia no Brasil: 1840–1900</em> (Rio de Janeiro: Funarte, 1985), 20. <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The GRI’s photographic collection has important holdings from Brazil, such as the collection of aforementioned historian Gilberto Ferrez, grandson of renowned Brazilian photographer Marc Ferrez. The view by Lindemann joined other photographic panoramas taken in the country that were already part of the GRI’s collection, although those were mainly associated with the city of Rio de Janeiro, such as the panorama taken from the Ilha das Cobras (Isle of Snakes) by George Leuzinger (1813–92) around 1866; <em>Vue prise de Sta. Thereza</em> (View from Santa Theresa) taken by Marc Ferrez around 1890; and the urban view of Praça Floriano (Floriano Square) taken by Augusto César de Malta Campos in 1928. The latter two photographs are reproduced in Idurre Alonso and Maristella Casciato, <em>The Metropolis in Latin America, 1830–1930: Cityscapes, Photographs, Debates</em> (Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute, 2021), [pages TK], pls. 12 and 13. <a href=\"#fnref3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Panoramic photography was pioneered in 1845 in Paris by Friedrich von Martens, who developed a camera for panoramic daguerreotypes that produced views using a rotating lens with an angle of view potentially exceeding reaching 150 degrees. A detailed account of the technical evolution of the photographic panorama can be found in Gerardo Martinez-Delgado, “La ilusión de la ciudad total: Fotografía panorámica en México antes de 1910 e investigación en historia urbana,” <em>Cuicuilco: Revista de ciencias antropológicas</em> 24, no. 68 (2017): 101–33. <a href=\"#fnref4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The panorama as a pictorial medium was a British invention, patented in 1787 by Robert Barker, an Irish-born painter based in Edinburgh. It quickly became one of the most popular visual spectacles of its time. According to Colombian art historian Juanita Solano-Roa, its innovative way of presenting the world led to a paradigmatic change both in ways of seeing and in the logics of representation. The pictorial panorama broke with the historically prevailing linear perspective proposed by Reniassance theroist Leon Battista Alberti, which has one vanishing point, representing instead a continuous linear horizon. For a historical overview of the invention and circulation of pictorial panoramas, see Carla Hermann, “Landscape and Power: Taunay’s and Burford’s Panoramas of Rio de Janeiro in Paris and London in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century,” <em>Artelogie,</em> no. 10 (2017): 1–10; and Juanita Solano-Roa, “Fotoramas: Jorge Obando y la fotografía panorámica de los años treinta en Colombia,” <em>Revista Historia y Sociedad,</em> no. 43 (2022): 69–91. <a href=\"#fnref5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Jonathan Crary, <em>Techniques of the Observer: On Vision and Modernity in the Nineteenth Century</em> (Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1990); Ana María Guash, <em>Arte y archivo:</em> (Madrid: Akal, 2011); Allan Sekula, <em>Photography Against the Grain: Essays and Photo Works 1973–1983</em> (Halifax: Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, 1984); and Allan Sekula, “Reading an Archive: Photography between Labour and Capital,” in <em>The Photography Reader,</em> ed.

It contains ninety-four images of Brazil, with photographs by Marc Ferrez, Lindemann, and Joaquim Insley Pacheco, among others, as well as lithographic drawings based on photos. According to Kossoy, it can be considered the final piece of publicity for Brazil produced by the imperial government as it entered into decline, given that the album was published less than a year before the Proclamation of the Republic of Brazil.

The other photograph, apparently taken in the same year, is much smaller in size, but for Gilberto Ferrez is “the sharpest and most perfect, never equaled” panoramic photograph taken from the coast of Salvador’s city center during the nineteenth century. The quality of the photograph is very good, offering total sharpness in all the buildings, allowing viewers to observe—up close and in great detail—the skyline of the city and its architecture in the mid-1800s. It was captured in three parts and measuring 11.7 by 62.5 centimeters, is reproduced in Ferrez, <em>Bahía: Velhas fotografias 1858–1900</em> (Salvador: Livraria Kosmos, 1988), 32–33.
